This could lead to reputational risks and missed opportunities for improvement.\n- The building industry's environmental impact scrutiny highlights a potential gap in our sustainability strategy, especially if not addressing the industry's concerns and implementing greener practices to mitigate climate change.\n\n### Recommendations\n1. Implement a supplier sustainability evaluation framework sooner than 2026 to proactively address risks associated with supplier practices and enhance overall sustainability performance.\n2. Enhance focus on green building practices and circular economy initiatives to align with industry demands and mitigate environmental impact, potentially through partnerships with green building experts.\n3. Strengthen internal and external communication on sustainability efforts, progress, and goals, aligning with the rising public awareness and discourse on climate issues to enhance stakeholder engagement and trust.\n4. Consider setting interim targets for Scope 3 emissions measurement before 2025 to accelerate progress towards full GHG emissions reporting and demonstrate commitment to holistic sustainability management.\n5. Explore opportunities for innovation and investment in resilient technologies to address vulnerabilities highlighted by extreme solar storms, ensuring continuity of operations and preparedness for potential climate-related disasters."
