<p>
  Every week, our system tracks and summarizes the most important developments in sustainability and ESG policy. Using a powerful combination of a large language model and an intelligent AI agent, the tool analyzes news from reliable sources and generates a structured report highlighting key movements across legislation, industry trends, strategic decisions, and sustainability milestones.

<p>
  But we don’t stop there. The system goes a step further by connecting this national and global context to your company’s specific sustainability position. Through a second AI agent, your company’s profile—built from a set of targeted questions—is evaluated against the week’s developments. The result? A personalized, actionable sustainability report that identifies strengths, weaknesses, risks, and areas for improvement.

  All data, analysis, and company evaluations are stored in a structured and searchable local database. This creates a valuable historical archive that supports ongoing analysis, progress tracking, and better understanding of trends or anomalies over time.

  In a landscape where ESG expectations—particularly those influenced by EU legislation—are constantly evolving, this product delivers a strategic edge. It ensures sustainability actions are informed, aligned, and proactive, helping organizations remain compliant and transparent while building stakeholder trust.
