Vi bliver derfor n\u00f8dt til at omdanne flere af de organismer, mineraler og naturkr\u00e6fter, som havet rummer, til de produkter og tjenester, vi har brug for.\n\nI mange tilf\u00e6lde kan marine produkter og tjenester have markant mindre milj\u00f8m\u00e6ssige fodaftryk end deres landbaserede modparter \u2013 hvis de udvikles p\u00e5 den rette m\u00e5de. Hos Nordic Innovation vil vi is\u00e6r fremh\u00e6ve to ting, der er n\u00f8dvendige for en s\u00e5dan udvikling: innovation og investeringer.\n\nI mange tilf\u00e6lde kan marine produkter og tjenester have markant mindre milj\u00f8m\u00e6ssige fodaftryk end deres landbaserede modparter \u2013 hvis de udvikles p\u00e5 den rette m\u00e5de.\n\nInnovation i form af nye teknologiske l\u00f8sninger og forretningsmodeller er en m\u00e5de at overvinde barrierer i forskellige sektorer. Tag havvindm\u00f8ller som et eksempel. Havvinden er en strategisk ressource i Nordens rejse mod energiuafh\u00e6ngighed og kan spille en central rolle i den energiv\u00e6rdik\u00e6de, der er n\u00f8dvendig for den gr\u00f8nne omstilling. Samtidig m\u00f8der udbygningen af havvind i Norden betydelige udfordringer \u2013 besv\u00e6rlige tilladelsesprocesser, \u00f8konomiske barrierer og ikke mindst sikkerhedssp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l. Innovation kan tilbyde en vej uden om disse forhindringer. N\u00e5r det g\u00e6lder sikkerhed, kan havvind endda blive en mulighed frem for en risiko, ved at blive integreret med avancerede systemer til overv\u00e5gning og varsling.\n\nNordic Innovation yder konkret st\u00f8tte til innovation, der l\u00f8ser s\u00e5danne udfordringer i hav\u00f8konomien. Projekterne OFFWOFF og Nordic BioBuz har for eksempel udviklet og testet nye modeller for flerbrugsaktiviteter til havs som svar p\u00e5 den stigende konkurrence om maritime arealer. Her \u2013 som i alt, hvad vi st\u00f8tter \u2013 s\u00f8ger vi den nordiske merv\u00e6rdi: det, vi kun kan opn\u00e5 ved at udnytte de specifikke styrker, der findes i vores lande, i f\u00e6llesskab.\n\nNorden har s\u00e6rlige styrker. Det afspejler sig ikke mindst i det faktum, at hav\u00f8konomien udg\u00f8r 15 % af regionens \u00e5rlige BNP. Men vi kunne g\u00f8re endnu mere \u2013 hvis vi investerede mere. For at g\u00f8re investorer af forskellige typer og st\u00f8rrelser opm\u00e6rksomme p\u00e5 de muligheder, der findes inden for hav\u00f8konomien, har vi bestilt rapporten The Nordic Ocean Opportunity. Rapporten, som lanceres under FN\u2019s havkonference i Nice 11. juni 2025, peger p\u00e5 en r\u00e6kke forskellige investeringsmuligheder \u2013 b\u00e5de n\u00e5r det g\u00e6lder optimering af eksisterende aktiviteter og nye l\u00f8sninger og anvendelser.\n\nNorden har s\u00e6rlige styrker.

I stedet for en fri og ubegr\u00e6nset ressource, bliver det nu noget, der skal forvaltes og beskyttes aktivt for at bevare \u2013 og \u00f8ge \u2013 dets v\u00e6rdi. Norden er alt ledende p\u00e5 dette omr\u00e5de, men det er stort potentiale for videre innovation som kombinerer det gr\u00f8nne og det bl\u00e5. Denne forvaltning af havets aktiviteter omfatter genopretning af \u00f8kosystemer, forebyggelse af overudnyttelse og udvikling af nye markedsmuligheder s\u00e5som bl\u00e5 CO\u2082-kreditter eller tjenester til genopretning af levesteder.\n\nB\u00e6redygtig havforvaltning og b\u00e6redygtig hav\u00f8konomi kr\u00e6ver s\u00e5vel st\u00e6rkt samarbejde mellem de nordiske lande, som samspil med erhvervslivet for at udvikle nye nordiske l\u00f8sninger som kan have global indvirkning.

      "text": "Formand for DD-Ungdom (Danmarksdemokraternes Ungdom)\n\nDette indl\u00e6g er alene udtryk for skribentens egen holdning. Alle indl\u00e6g hos Altinget skal overholde de presseetiske regler.\n\nI Danmarksdemokraternes Ungdom mener vi, at skatter og afgifter er et ineffektivt og direkte \u00f8del\u00e6ggende redskab i den gr\u00f8nne omstillings navn. Traditionelt set har venstrefl\u00f8jen argumenteret for, at h\u00f8jere afgifter p\u00e5 CO2 og andre milj\u00f8belastende aktiviteter vil tvinge virksomheder og borgere til at \u00e6ndre adf\u00e6rd. Men det rammer b\u00e5de socialt og geografisk sk\u00e6vt. Det betyder, at de mere velhavende forts\u00e6tter deres forbrugsvaner, mens dem, der er mere \u00f8konomisk tr\u00e6ngte, bliver tvunget til at omstille deres forbrug.\n\nL\u00e6s ogs\u00e5\n\nDrop de socialistiske dummeb\u00f8der N\u00e5r vi eksempelvis h\u00e6ver afgifterne p\u00e5 benzin og diesel, rammer det is\u00e6r dem, som er afh\u00e6ngige af bilen i forbindelse med deres arbejde, eller dem, der bor i omr\u00e5der med begr\u00e6nset offentlig transport. Det er tilf\u00e6ldet for folk uden for de store byer. En bil er ikke en luksus i vores landdistrikter \u2013 det er en direkte n\u00f8dvendighed for at f\u00e5 hverdagen til at h\u00e6nge sammen. Det er vigtigt, at vi ikke bare smider ansvaret ud p\u00e5 landet, men at vi i f\u00e6llesskab i hele Danmark b\u00e6rer ansvaret. Patrick Culmsee-Bryhl, Marcus Gr\u00f8nb\u00e6k og L\u00e6rke Wind\n\nHhv. formand, FU-medlem og politisk ordf\u00f8rer, DDU N\u00e5r man pisker befolkningen med afgifter og socialistiske dummeb\u00f8der, skaber man blot et A- og et B-hold, hvor gr\u00f8ften mellem rig og fattig, by og land, blot vil blive endnu st\u00f8rre. Borgerlige v\u00e6rdier handler ogs\u00e5 om at give individet ansvar. Mange borgere vil gerne tage del i den gr\u00f8nne omstilling, hvis det er \u00f8konomisk fornuftigt og lettilg\u00e6ngeligt. Derfor b\u00f8r vi fremme l\u00f8sninger, hvor borgerne selv v\u00e6lger b\u00e6redygtige alternativer frem for at blive tvunget og pisket gennem skatter og afgifter. Forbrugeransvar kan styrkes gennem bedre information og transparens. Hvis virksomheder m\u00e6rker deres produkter tydeligt med CO2-aftryk, vil mange forbrugere naturligt v\u00e6lge de gr\u00f8nnere alternativer. Det samme g\u00e6lder energisektoren: N\u00e5r b\u00e6redygtige energiformer bliver prism\u00e6ssigt konkurrencedygtige, vil flere v\u00e6lge dem frivilligt. Ansvaret skal ikke kunne falde p\u00e5 dem fra landet Den frie markeds\u00f8konomi er i sig selv en kraftfuld motor for gr\u00f8n omstilling. N\u00e5r virksomheder ser en \u00f8konomisk fordel i b\u00e6redygtighed, vil de investere i det. Hvis en bilproducent kan producere en elbil billigere end en fossilbil, uden at staten skal tvinge forbrugeren med afgifter, vil elbiler uundg\u00e5eligt dominere markedet. Den borgerlige tilgang til klimapolitik m\u00e5 i stedet fokusere p\u00e5 teknologi og innovation. Markedet har allerede vist, at virksomheder kan skabe banebrydende l\u00f8sninger. Vi skal bruge guleroden frem for pisken. Vi bliver n\u00f8dt til at investere i den gr\u00f8nne omstilling og give gr\u00f8nne virksomheder de rette vilk\u00e5r for at kunne v\u00e6kste og udvikle.\n\nL\u00e6s ogs\u00e5",

      "text": "\n\nAs the IMO finalises global mandates for maritime decarbonisation, Alexander Tancock, CEO of InterContinental Energy (ICE), discusses how the timing for green e-fuels couldn\u2019t be better \u2013 and how it is now up to the shipping industry to commit.\n\nIf we can\u2019t deliver ammonia near $650 per tonne, in large volumes, we don\u2019t have a market. But if we can, and I believe we can, shipping has a viable, scalable path to net zero.\n\nICE has spent the past decade building a pipeline of giga-scale green hydrogen and ammonia projects designed with one mission: deliver up to 46m tonnes per annum of cost-competitive green e-fuels by 2050.\n\nWith the International Maritime Organization (IMO) set to enforce binding emissions reductions from 2028, and with alternative fuel propulsion systems finally approaching readiness, the question for shipping is no longer when to act, but whether the fuel will be there in time. The answer is it can be\u2026but the shipping industry needs to commit to offtake soon because of the long lead times needed for the best projects to proceed.\n\nICE\u2019s Western Green Energy Hub (WGEH) in Western Australia is a good example of the sort of project that shipping will rely on for low-cost and high-volume green e-fuels. Already in development for five years, it spans an area over half the size of Denmark, will have a production capacity of up to 28m tonnes per annum of green ammonia, and is targeting first phase production in the early 2030s at a price of sub-$650 a tonne. That timeline is no accident: When we look at engine readiness and the IMO mandates \u2013 the early 2030s are when we see significant demand emerging and we are syncing our delivery to that curve.\n\nAnd it seems the shipping sector is paying attention. Two years ago, InterContinental Energy wasn\u2019t on the shipping community radar. Now, I was just invited to deliver the opening keynote speech at Nor-Shipping\u2019s Maritime Hydrogen Conference. The change is real.\n\nThat change is being driven by the IMO\u2019s Net-Zero Framework, which includes a global fuel standard and tiered GHG pricing and penalties. With well-to-wake accounting on the horizon, scalable green ammonia mega projects, with zero point-of-use emissions, become an increasingly attractive long term supply choice.\n\nBut the shipping sector faces a moment of truth: Supply and demand must evolve together. Without credible, bankable demand signals, even the most advanced projects won\u2019t make it to final investment decision (FID), and therefore supply will not materialize in time.\n\nA scalable system for a global challenge\n\nAt the heart of ICE\u2019s delivery strategy is our P2(H\u2082)Node architecture: a patented modular \u2018Lego block\u2019 architecture that combines renewable generation, electrolysis, and ammonia synthesis at the point of resource. By eliminating long-distance power transmission and centralising infrastructure around scalable modules, we are cutting capex by as much as 20% \u2013 leading to a direct reduction in green e-fuel prices.\n\nOur nodes aren\u2019t just a technical configuration; they\u2019re a strategy to reduce project risk and increase customer confidence. Each node functions as a self-contained production unit. With a gigawatt-scale layout optimised for solar and wind co-location, our approach not only reduces cost, but also makes green certification simple, since only renewable energy is used for inputs.\n\nGreen ammonia production at this scale requires not just good solar and wind conditions, but integrated logistics, port infrastructure, and a development strategy that spans decades. We are building in Australia and Oman because the conditions, both natural and political, are aligned for this success.\n\nBuilding the first node for a project is the hardest part. It needs support, it needs government help. But once it\u2019s built, every node after that is cheaper, faster, and easier \u2013 and that\u2019s how we can scale product and continually reduce cost to customers. WGEH isn\u2019t in fact one mega project, it is 35 repeatable Lego blocks that will be built in series, one after the other, delivering increasing annual output for more than two decades.\n\nFor shipping, this isn\u2019t just theoretical anymore, and if demand warrants, we are ready to double the construction rate. We already have the engineering and land access; it\u2019s purely a function of demand.\n\nThe role of the Australian government has been vital. Programmes like Hydrogen Headstart, the Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive, and dedicated export frameworks offer a level of certainty few countries can match. We have always chosen partners carefully. Not just financial or technical, but geopolitical. Governments that understand what\u2019s at stake \u2013 and Australia gets it.\n\nThe shipping community\u2019s move to make\n\nSome shipowners are already taking steps by entering MOUs, conducting bunkering trials, and retrofitting vessels to be ammonia-ready. But the broader industry has yet to deliver the bold procurement commitments that would catalyse low cost production at scale.\n\nThe reward for those who act early could be significant. Under the IMO\u2019s Net-Zero Fund model, early adopters will likely benefit from credit trading mechanisms and preferential financing. Regulatory momentum is aligned with strategic advantage.\n\nGreen ammonia is no longer a theoretical future fuel. It is a ready-now solution that can scale with demand and meet compliance head-on\u2026provided customers commitment.\n\nWe\u2019ve built the model. The infrastructure is planned. The economics work. What\u2019s needed now is offtake. If the demand signal comes, we\u2019ll deliver. But this time, the signal has to come from shipping.",

      "text": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Israel\u2019s overnight airstrikes on Iran drove up freight rates and tanker stocks Friday as traders and investors priced in the prospect of disruption to a large swath of the global oil-shipping fleet.\n\nForward freight agreements for July \u2014 bets on the future cost of moving Middle East crude to Asia \u2014 jumped 15% to $12.83 a metric ton, according to data from brokerage Marex Group Plc. Shipbrokers and owners said actual charter rates were higher too.\n\nTanker stocks jumped, with one of the world\u2019s top owners saying it was more wary of leasing out its vessels in the region. People involved in the freight market reported a large number of firms declining to offer their vessels for hire while they take stock of what\u2019s happened.\n\nIsrael struck targets across Iran early Friday, including nuclear and military facilities. The operation marked a significant escalation in the standoff between the two adversaries, with Tehran vowing its foe will \u201cpay a very heavy price.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now, this is a risk premium \u2014 owners will hold back from putting ships into the Gulf on a business-as-usual basis,\u201d said Anoop Singh, global head of shipping research at Oil Brokerage Ltd. \u201cA threat of war in the Middle East is material to freight rates.\u201d\n\nThe attacks have revived longstanding concerns in oil and shipping markets that Iran could try to shut the Strait of Hormuz, an unavoidable chokepoint for a large chunk of the world\u2019s petroleum.\n\nTehran has made multiple threats to close the waterway over the years, even if there are good reasons to believe it wouldn\u2019t do so for any long period of time.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t preclude harassment of commercial ships that are controlled by Iran\u2019s rivals, making voyages more fraught and owners more wary \u2014 a tactic Tehran has deployed in the past.\n\nTokyo-based shipping companies Nippon Yusen KK, Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd. and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. were among the first to instruct vessels to exercise caution after the overnight strikes.\n\nAmong Asian stocks, Cosco Shipping Holdings Co. and China Merchants Energy Shipping Co. rose more than 5% on Friday. In Europe, Frontline Plc jumped as much as 7.9% in Oslo before paring its gains.\n\n\u201cWe are far more hesitant\u201d about offering vessels for charter from the Middle East, said Lars Barstad, chief executive officer of the company that manages Frontline\u2019s fleet.\n\nNavy Warning\n\nBefore the attacks, the UK Navy had warned that any escalation could affect shipping, including in the Strait of Hormuz, through which much of the world\u2019s seaborne oil and gas flows.\n\nSimilarly, the Joint Maritime Information Center, an information-sharing hub that comes under the Combined Maritime Forces, warned of heightened risks from the hostilities, including the possible use of missiles around chokepoints.\n\nThe JMIC said Friday that there are signs that ships\u2019 electronics are increasingly being jammed and that vessel operators should \u201cbe ready with alternative options should navigation aids fail.\u201d\n\nBarstad said that during past flare-ups, shipping had been organized into \u201cflotillas\u201d that move through Hormuz under naval escort to keep them safe.\n\nBut such a measure is very inefficient \u2014 and hence bullish for freight \u2014 because tankers are forced to wait to transit rather than moving freely, he said.\n\nBlocking Hormuz, the entry and exit point for tankers picking up cargoes from key oil producers in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait \u2014 and even Iran itself \u2014 is seen as an extreme option. The country\u2019s oil-consuming allies need the waterway to function normally. While a closure is possible, it\u2019s unlikely that such an act would be long-lasting, Barstad said.\n\nVLCC Traffic\n\nAt least 10% of the global very-large crude carrier fleet are in the Middle East Gulf at any given time, with about 20 vessels transiting the Strait of Hormuz each day.\n\nBarstad, speaking early Friday, said that the market would take its cue from the premiums that war-risk insurers charge.\n\nNeil Roberts, secretary of the Joint War Committee that determines the world\u2019s riskiest waters for insurers, said insurers already have to be notified when ships are passing through the area in question because it is already a so-called Listed Area.\n\n\u201cThe chance of collateral damage is perhaps raised but the current strikes are not at marine targets,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cFrom the marine perspective, it\u2019s a case of keeping aware of developments and acting accordingly.\u201d\n\nThere are also ways in which disruption could actually prove bearish for tanker markets. A surge in oil prices that erodes demand wouldn\u2019t be helpful, and nor would a long-lasting restriction in Middle East crude cargoes.\n\nStill, the strikes will help ancillary services that provide safety of passage for ships through the region, said Jayendu Krishna, a director at Drewry Maritime Services.\n\nBulk carrier rates may also benefit: The Middle East contributes more than 10% of the global dry-bulk trade, which handles unpackaged commodities such as ores and minerals, he said.\n\n\u201cAdditional war-risk premium will suddenly shoot up, to and from the Middle East,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cIt takes time to recalibrate the supply chain.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) released its Maritime Barometer Report 2024-2025 today in Athens, revealing a deepening concern among maritime leaders about their ability to navigate an increasingly complex risk landscape.\n\nThe report, drawing on four years of comprehensive survey data, identifies political instability as the industry\u2019s most pressing concern, maintaining its top position for the third consecutive year. This finding comes at a time when global trade instability has reached record levels, setting a critical backdrop for the Shaping the Future of Shipping Summit in Athens.\n\n\u201cGeopolitical instability is no longer a background factor, it is actively reshaping our operating conditions, redrawing trade routes, and influencing commercial decisions across the globe,\u201d said ICS Chairman Emanuele Grimaldi.\n\nThe summit has drawn high-level participation from across the maritime sector, including Vassilis Kikilias, Greece\u2019s Minister of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, and Fu Xuyin, Vice-Minister of Transport from China.\n\nBeyond geopolitical concerns, the report highlights cybersecurity as an emerging top-tier risk. Industry leaders express growing unease about vulnerabilities associated with digital integration and emerging technologies, particularly in the current geopolitical climate.\n\nThe regulatory landscape, especially concerning decarbonization and emissions, emerged as another significant challenge. The industry faces evolving regulations, with a crucial Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting at the IMO scheduled for October 2025. The report indicates a consistent decline in shipping leaders\u2019 confidence to manage both geopolitical and regulatory challenges, with many seeking clearer pathways for meeting decarbonization goals.\n\nThis fifth iteration of the Shaping the Future of Shipping Summit builds on previous successes, including the establishment of the Maritime Just Transition Task Force and Clean Energy Marine Hubs. The summit aims to forge stronger collaboration between industry and governments, which Grimaldi describes as essential for addressing challenges ranging from the green transition to cyber threats and trade barriers.\n\nThe ICS, representing over 80% of the world\u2019s merchant fleet, positions the Barometer Report as both a diagnostic tool and a call to action for coordinated responses across the global maritime value chain. The findings will inform discussions at both the Summit and the following ICS AGM.\n\nAs the maritime sector confronts these multifaceted challenges, the report emphasizes that solutions are within reach, but unity and coordination among stakeholders will be crucial for successfully navigating the industry\u2019s future.",

      "text": "The Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) has issued an advisory about potential maritime security impacts in the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Northern Arabian Sea after Israeli authorities reportedly issued an ultimatum requiring a nuclear agreement between Iran and the United States by Sunday, with warnings of military action if negotiations fail.\n\nThe United States and Iran are set to hold sixth round of nuclear talks on Sunday.\n\nWhile the JMIC advisory notes there are currently no direct threats to commercial shipping, the proximity of potential conflict zones to critical maritime chokepoints has raised concerns about rapid escalation. The situation is further complicated by threats from non-state actors, including the Houthis, who have indicated their intention to respond if U.S. involvement in an attack on Iran is suspected.\n\nThe escalation comes as the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s Board of Governors declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations, marking the first such declaration in almost two decades.\n\nMarkets have already reacted to the tensions, with global oil prices surging more than 4% to their highest levels since early April. Paul McNamara, director of emerging market debt at GAM, warns that \u201cthere is a lot of scope for things to get a whole lot worse if we do see a military strike and a sustained attack.\u201d\n\nMartin Kelly, Head of Advisory at EOS Risk Group, said Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities are definitely on the table for Israeli targeting, along with other potential energy infrastructure in Bushehr and oil loading terminals at Kharg Island that would be deemed less escalatory, prompting retaliatory attacks from Iran.\n\n\u201cCommerical shipping is an obvious target set in a tit-for-tat move to impact global oil markets. Iran could seize, mine or missile attack affiliated or non-affiliated shipping in the AG, SoH or GoO, missile ranges extend beyond that,\u201d Kelly wrote on X.\n\n\u201cHouthis could reimplement the Red Sea blockade whilst increasing UAV/BM attacks against Israel,\u201d he added.\n\nJMIC advises vessels in the region to maintain close contact with maritime security centers and keep communication equipment continuously manned. The organization will continue issuing daily updates until the outcome of Sunday\u2019s talks.",

      "text": "Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind has terminated its 1.5-gigawatt offshore wind project in New Jersey, marking a significant setback for the U.S. offshore wind industry amid mounting federal opposition.\n\nThe project, which would have powered more than 700,000 homes, fell victim to a series of aggressive policy measures by the Trump administration aimed at dismantling the domestic offshore wind sector.\n\nThe administration\u2019s actions included an executive order halting all offshore wind leasing nationwide, substantial staff reductions at the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Management, and the rescinding of federal permits for the Atlantic Shores project off Atlantic City\u2019s coast. Adding to these challenges, pending budget reconciliation legislation threatens to eliminate tax incentives for offshore wind deployment.\n\nJason Walsh, Executive Director of the BlueGreen Alliance, condemned the administration\u2019s actions: \u201cTrump continues trying to destroy the future of offshore wind in the United States. The potential of this clean power source is being realized around the world, but because of President Trump\u2019s sabotage, our country is sacrificing good jobs, lower energy prices, and benefits to countless communities in New Jersey and across the country.\u201d\n\nThe Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) auctioned Lease OCS-A 0499 in 2015 and approved the Atlantic Shores South Construction and Operations Plan in October 2024, authorizing two wind facilities that could generate 2,800 megawatts combined.\n\nThe developer, a unit of EDF Renewables North America, had invested hundreds of millions in pre-construction work, including permits, interconnection agreements, supply-chain contracts, community support, and workforce development. The project also faced major setback earlier this year when Shell withdrew as a partner in January 2025, taking a $996 million impairment\n\nFurther complications arose when the Environmental Protection Agency suspended key permits for the project in response to a January 21 Executive Order from President Trump, effectively withdrawing the Clean Air Act permit issued in September 2024 to reassess the project\u2019s environmental impacts. Prior to the suspension, the project had secured approval for up to 200 wind turbines with a potential capacity of 2,800 megawatts.\n\nThe developer\u2019s formal petition to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities cited multiple challenges, including soaring inflation and supply chain disruptions. However, the federal freeze on offshore wind permitting initiated by the Trump Administration in January proved to be the decisive factor.\n\n\u201cOffshore wind continues to offer New Jersey a strong value proposition that includes thousands of good-paying jobs, stable power prices, and real economic benefits,\u201d said Atlantic Shores CEO Joris Veldhoven.\n\nThe cancellation poses a significant threat to New Jersey\u2019s clean energy ambitions, which include a target of 11 gigawatts of offshore wind electricity by 2040 \u2013 planned to represent 30% of East Coast wind energy production.\n\nThe impact of President Trump executive action extends beyond New Jersey. The Empire Wind project offshore New York recently experienced a month-long suspension following a stop work order from the Trump Administration on April 16th over what Interior Secretary Doug Burgum alleged alleged were concerns over the previous Biden Administration\u2019s regulatory approval process.\n\nDespite these challenges, this $5 billion project, designed to power 500,000 New York homes by 2027, remains 30% complete and construction has since continued.",
