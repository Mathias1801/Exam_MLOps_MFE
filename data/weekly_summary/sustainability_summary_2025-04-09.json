There is a need for greater political vision and support to create a framework for effective climate adaptation. Key demands include recognizing the need for increased resources and changes in policies to facilitate both climate adaptation and sustainable transformation. There is a call to move away from outdated economic control of the water sector that hinders progress and towards better support and frameworks for innovative cross-disciplinary work.\n\n**Industry insight:**\n- The waste sector is highlighted as a significant player in municipal green transition efforts. Efforts to reduce waste and promote recycling are crucial for sustainability. The sector has been focusing on waste sorting at households and promoting both waste collection and incineration. There is a need for better organization and pricing of waste management, as well as involving stakeholders in sustainable waste solutions.\n\n**Strategic insight:**\n- The need for a comprehensive climate adaptation law is emphasized to provide a stronger foundation for addressing climate challenges. The current economic control of the water sector is seen as a barrier to innovative solutions. There is a call for better collaboration across sectors and innovative approaches, especially in green infrastructure development. Investments in climate adaptation are crucial, with a recent political agreement paving the way for significant investments in safeguarding buildings at risk from high groundwater levels.\n\n**General insight:**\n- The discussion around the effectiveness of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) as a climate solution is raised, with concerns about its technological uncertainties and reliance on maintaining current consumption patterns. Calls for focusing on known sustainable solutions like energy efficiency, reduced consumption, and sustainable resource use are advocated for a more effective green transition. The importance of aligning national targets with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the need for concrete and actionable plans to achieve sustainability goals are highlighted.\n\nIn summary, there is a clear push towards more effective climate adaptation and sustainable solutions in Denmark, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches, cross-sector collaboration, and a shift towards greener practices in various industries. Efforts are being made to align national strategies with international sustainability goals and enhance overall environmental policies and initiatives for a more sustainable future."
