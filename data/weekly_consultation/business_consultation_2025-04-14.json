This external trend supports our emphasis on green logistics, renewable sourcing, and reducing water intensity.\n\n- **Industry insight**: The financial support for zero-emission trucks in Denmark presents an opportunity for our company to explore similar initiatives in our operations. Transitioning more of our vehicle fleet to electric vehicles could align with this trend and also contribute to our net-zero targets.\n\n- **General insight**: The EU's policies promoting environmental protection and competitiveness resonate with our sustainability goals. Emphasizing these aspects in our strategy can enhance alignment with external developments and strengthen our market position.\n\n\n### Gaps/Risks:\n\n- **Strategic insight**: While Denmark is advancing legislative proposals for SDGs and establishing funds for sustainability goals, our company currently lacks a formal evaluation of supplier sustainability practices. This gap could expose us to risks related to supply chain sustainability and compliance with evolving regulations.\n\n- **General insight**: The call for continued efforts in climate and environmental actions underscores the importance of staying committed to sustainability. Failing to measure and report Scope 3 emissions could pose a risk in terms of transparency and accountability, especially as stakeholders increasingly focus on broader carbon footprints.\n\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n1. **Enhance Supplier Sustainability Evaluation**:\n   - Develop a framework for evaluating supplier sustainability practices to mitigate risks associated with supply chain sustainability. Consider incorporating sustainability criteria into procurement processes.\n\n2. **Expand Scope 3 Emissions Reporting**:\n   - Prioritize measuring and reporting Scope 3 emissions to enhance transparency and align with evolving stakeholder expectations. This action can demonstrate a comprehensive approach to emissions management.\n\n3. **Invest in Electric Vehicle Transition**:\n   - Capitalize on the opportunity presented by the zero-emission truck initiative in Denmark by accelerating the transition of our vehicle fleet to electric vehicles. This investment not only aligns with external trends but also contributes to our net-zero targets and showcases leadership in sustainable transportation practices.\n\n4. **Strengthen Reporting Practices**:\n   - Consider enhancing reporting practices by aligning with GRI and TCFD recommendations. Improving the integration of sustainability metrics in regular reports can enhance credibility and transparency.\n\n5. **Engage Employees in Sustainability Initiatives**:\n   - Launch initiatives to engage employees in sustainability efforts, building a culture of sustainability within the organization. Employee involvement can drive innovation, improve operational efficiency, and foster a sense of shared responsibility towards sustainability goals."
