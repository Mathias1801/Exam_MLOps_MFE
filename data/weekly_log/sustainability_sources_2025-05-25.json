I stedet m\u00f8des virksomhederne ofte af uigennemskuelige krav, uforudsigelig sagsbehandling og regler, der ikke er tilpasset virkeligheden.\n\nLov om vanvidsk\u00f8rsel er uretf\u00e6rdig\n\nEt godt eksempel er de nuv\u00e6rende regler om vanvidsk\u00f8rsel. De blev indf\u00f8rt med en forst\u00e5elig intention \u2013 at s\u00e6tte h\u00e5rdt ind mod farlige bilister.\n\nMen virkeligheden er, at biludlejere og leasingselskaber i dag risikerer at f\u00e5 deres biler konfiskeret, hvis en kunde k\u00f8rer vanvidsk\u00f8rsel \u2013 uanset at virksomheden hverken har ansvar eller mulighed for at forhindre det.\n\nDet er b\u00e5de uproportionalt og uretf\u00e6rdigt.\n\nFor os handler det ikke om at fjerne kontrol eller sv\u00e6kke forbrugersikkerheden. Det handler om at sikre, at reglerne giver mening og underst\u00f8tter det samfund, vi gerne vil udvikle. Jesper H\u00f8jte Stenb\u00e6k\n\nFungerende sekretariatschef. Dansk Mobilitet\n\nEt andet omr\u00e5de er momsh\u00e5ndtering. Her oplever is\u00e6r biludlejningsbranchen, at reglerne er uklare og praksis uforudsigelig.\n\nDet betyder, at virksomheder risikerer store efterregninger \u2013 ikke fordi de har fors\u00f8gt at snyde, men fordi reglerne er for d\u00e5rligt definerede.\n\nEndelig foresl\u00e5r vi at \u00e6ndre kravet om brugerregistrering ved billeje fra 29 til 90 dage. I dag umuligg\u00f8r reglerne stort set langtidsleje for private forbrugere \u2013 en l\u00f8sning, som ellers b\u00e5de kan v\u00e6re \u00f8konomisk og klimam\u00e6ssigt fornuftig.\n\nDet er ikke nyt, at virksomheder oplever lovgivningen som en barriere. En analyse fra Dansk Erhverv viser, at netop regulering og administration i dag vurderes som den st\u00f8rste hindring for v\u00e6kst. Det b\u00f8r give anledning til eftertanke p\u00e5 Christiansborg.\n\nFor os handler det ikke om at fjerne kontrol eller sv\u00e6kke forbrugersikkerheden. Det handler om at sikre, at reglerne giver mening og underst\u00f8tter det samfund, vi gerne vil udvikle. Nemlig et gr\u00f8nt, effektivt og konkurrencedygtigt Danmark.\n\nDerfor h\u00e5ber vi, at vores udspil bliver taget alvorligt \u2013 og ikke mindst bliver brugt som afs\u00e6t til at skabe bedre vilk\u00e5r for fremtidens mobilitet.",

V\u00e6ksten skal ikke v\u00e6k, den skal \u00e6ndres.\n\nDet er blevet et dydsetisk dogme at v\u00e6re imod enhver form for \u00f8konomisk v\u00e6kst, da v\u00e6ksten historisk set har smadret vores klode.\n\nDet er en forandring som mange dele af venstrefl\u00f8jen mods\u00e6tter sig. Anti-v\u00e6kstbev\u00e6gelsen har mange navne: nulv\u00e6kst, minusv\u00e6kst, modv\u00e6kst. Men uanset navnet har den altid samme samfundsundergravende undertoner. For dem er v\u00e6kst ikke et \u00f8konomisk, men et etisk begreb.\n\nHvis vi vil forbedre samfundet p\u00e5 sigt, kr\u00e6ver det et samfund i balance med kloden. Vi bliver n\u00f8dt til at \u00e6ndre farven p\u00e5 vores v\u00e6kstforst\u00e5else fra sort til gr\u00f8n.\n\nVi har indset, at den m\u00e5de, vi har v\u00e6kstet p\u00e5, har skadet jorden mindst lige s\u00e5 meget, som den har gavnet mennesket. Vores velstand er bygget p\u00e5 et fort\u00e6rende brug af naturressourcer, som ikke er i balance med planeten.\n\nVi har p\u00e5 mange m\u00e5der opbygget et dr\u00f8mmesamfund, som er fantastisk at leve i. Men nu er vi blevet klogere.\n\nS\u00e5dan udviklede vi os fra en befolkning best\u00e5ende af fattige b\u00f8nder, som h\u00f8stede korn dagen lang, til et videnssamfund, der skaber muligheder for rig s\u00e5vel som fattig.\n\nDen fossile \u00f8konomiske v\u00e6kst var effektiv, men det er tid til forandring; den skal nu g\u00f8res gr\u00f8n. \u00d8konomisk v\u00e6kst er en grundsten for et samfund, der er i udvikling.\n\nL\u00e6s ogs\u00e5\n\nDet er en illusion at tro, at markedet ikke vil eller ikke skal v\u00e6re en del af l\u00f8sningen p\u00e5 klimakrisen. Markedet er tv\u00e6rtimod n\u00f8glen til m\u00e5den, hvorp\u00e5 vi kommer i m\u00e5l.\n\nKlimakampen er vor tids vigtigste opgave og nok vor tids st\u00f8rste samfundsoml\u00e6gning. Vi skal fokusere langt mere p\u00e5 en samfunds\u00f8konomi, der via genbrug, optimering og dermed langt st\u00f8rre grad af effektivitet form\u00e5r at skabe v\u00e6kst og velstand uden at belaste kloden un\u00f8dvendigt.\n\nVi vil kunne g\u00f8re dette inden for markedets nuv\u00e6rende rammer uden at skulle destruere og genskabe hele vores samfundsmodel. Den form for sandkasse-mentalitet er spild af tid, vi slet ikke har.\n\nKun ved disse \u00e6ndringer i vores for\u00e6ldede \u00f8konomiske forst\u00e5else vil vi begynde at se et marked, der tager form efter de \u00f8kologiske kriser, vi st\u00e5r midt i.\n\nHer er det afg\u00f8rende, at vi indf\u00f8rer markante priss\u00e6tninger p\u00e5 klima- og milj\u00f8belastning s\u00e5som CO2e, kv\u00e6lstof, og arealforbrug. Ogs\u00e5 ressource- og mineralanvendelse b\u00f8r indt\u00e6nkes i vores v\u00e6rdik\u00e6der p\u00e5 en m\u00e5de, der g\u00f8r markedet ansvarlig for udnyttelsen, anvendelsen, deponeringen og genanvendelsen.\n\nDet g\u00f8r vi i dag delvist gennem vores k\u00f8bekraft, men det har tydeligvis ikke haft den effekt, det kr\u00e6ver, hvis vi for alvor vil g\u00f8re noget for den gr\u00f8nne omstilling.\n\nN\u00e5r vi har en s\u00e5 stor forandringskraft som vores samfunds\u00f8konomi, er det en foruds\u00e6tning for positiv forandring, at vi g\u00e5r sammen og stiller krav til, hvordan vores marked b\u00f8r udforme sig.\n\nDet er blevet et dydsetisk dogme at v\u00e6re imod enhver form for \u00f8konomisk v\u00e6kst.\n\nVi har et \u00f8konomisk system, der blot tilskriver d\u00e9t v\u00e6rdi, som kan blive solgt for penge. Alts\u00e5 har vi som samfund ikke valgt at frems\u00e6tte andre kriterier for, hvad der b\u00f8r anses som \u00f8konomisk succesfuldt, end hvad der kan s\u00e6lges. Og d\u00e9r har vi problemet.\n\nL\u00e6s ogs\u00e5\n\nDette m\u00e5 dog ikke misforst\u00e5s som et argument for, at markedet altid kan omstille sig eller er selvregulerende. En gr\u00f8n omstilling af vores \u00f8konomi og marked vil \u2013 og skal \u2013 kr\u00e6ve et ambiti\u00f8st statsligt mod til regulering. For det er netop markedet, der skal skabe v\u00e6kst og dermed mulighederne for et bedre samfund.\n\nVi mener, at venstrefl\u00f8jen i alt for h\u00f8j grad g\u00f8r klimakampen til en etisk diskussion.\n\nDette, mener vi, er en farlig vej at bev\u00e6ge sig ud p\u00e5: Klimakampen er simpelthen for vigtig. Vi har alt for travlt til, at vores \u00f8kologiske kriser skal g\u00f8res til en l\u00f8ftestang for samfundsomv\u00e6ltende v\u00e6rdipolitik.\n\nDet er derfor vigtigt, at vi som samfund form\u00e5r at l\u00f8fte i flok og skabe handling. Vi har brug for handling, ikke en afhandling.",

The design features medium pressure LCO2 Type-C tanks with a cargo capacity of 20,000 metric tons.\n\nThis development is part of the broader Tampa Regional Intermodal Carbon Hub (T-RICH) project, which aims to handle emissions from Florida industries for transport to regional sequestration sites. The T-RICH facility at Port Tampa Bay is designed to process two million metric tons of CO2 annually, with potential for future expansion.\n\nThe project received substantial backing in April 2024 when OSG secured a $3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy for the vessel\u2019s design and engineering. This followed an earlier DOE grant in December 2023 for the T-RICH development.\n\n\u201cThe safe transportation of CO2 plays a vital role in the carbon value chain, and ABS is proud to use our expertise as the world\u2019s leading classification society for gas carriers to support this milestone project for U.S. operations,\u201d said Gareth Burton, ABS Senior Vice President, Global Engineering.\n\nThe project addresses a critical infrastructure gap in Florida, which ranks fourth nationally in CO2 emissions from power generation and industrial facilities but lacks pipeline infrastructure for CO2 transport. The ATB will transport captured CO2 from the T-RICH terminal to sequestration sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico.\n\nKent Merrill, Aptamus Vice President of Marine Projects, highlighted that the design team is incorporating green technologies, including plans for the tug to utilize green methanol or other sustainable fuels.\n\nAccording to Sam Norton, OSG\u2019s President and CEO, carbon capture and storage systems are expected to play a crucial role in achieving U.S. carbon reduction goals, potentially contributing up to 30% of total emission reductions needed for net zero by 2050.\n\nThe project is anticipated to create hundreds of new jobs while accelerating the adoption of carbon emission reduction plans among Florida\u2019s industrial facilities.",

      "text": "By Mihir Mishra (Bloomberg) \u2014\n\nIndia plans to spend 850 billion rupees ($10 billion) to purchase 112 crude carriers through 2040, people familiar with the matter said, as the world\u2019s third-biggest importer of oil seeks to have its own fleet to secure supplies.\n\nState-owned oil companies currently operate an aging fleet that\u2019s mostly on-charter from global companies and the shipping and petroleum ministries want to change that, said the people, who asked not to be identified citing rules. The plan\u2019s first phase involves purchasing 79 ships, of which 30 of them would be medium-range vessels, they said.\n\nThe purchase order for 10 tankers should come out as early as this month, the people said. Only ships built locally \u2014 even if there\u2019s foreign collaboration \u2014 will be considered for purchase, they said.\n\nDespite the global push for transition to cleaner sources of energy, India\u2019s crude oil refining capacity is set to expand \u2014 to 450 million tons by the end of the decade from about 250 million tons now \u2014 on the back of growing domestic and overseas demand for oil products. For a nation that relies on imports for the bulk of its crude oil needs, it\u2019s imperative to have sufficient shipping capacity of its own to carry out its energy trade.\n\nIndia targets to raise the share of locally built oil tankers in its fleet to 7% by 2030 from 5% at present, the people said. The idea is to eventually increase it to 69% by 2047 \u2014 the deadline the country has set for becoming a developed nation.\n\nThe shipping and petroleum ministries and the government\u2019s Press Information Bureau didn\u2019t immediately respond to emailed requests for comments.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government this year announced a 250 billion-rupee fund to support the country\u2019s maritime sector, with one of its goals being to eventually reduce reliance on foreign-built vessels and bolster indigenous shipbuilding capacity.\n\nIndia is also planning to add shipping capacity for transporting coal, fertilizer and steel, the people said. The idea is to replace most of it with India-built ships going ahead.\n\nLacking Scale\n\nIndia\u2019s ship building industry is still nascent and lacks scale in the absence of sufficient captive demand for ships, the people said. The economies of scale will follow once global shipbuilding companies come to India and build for the world, they said.\n\nWhile the MT Maharshi Parashuram is the largest India-built oil tanker at 238-meters long and a deadweight tonnage of 93,332 metric tons, it dwarfs in comparison to China\u2019s Minsheng Financial Leasing-owned Oceania \u2014 a supertanker measuring 380 meters long and boasting a deadweight tonnage of 441,584 metric tons.\n\nThe Indian government\u2019s intent is to provide demand side stimulus for ship building companies, the people said, adding the country is inviting shipbuilders from Japan and South Korea to build ships with the promise of incentives.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s HD Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. is in discussions with India\u2019s state-owned Cochin Shipyard Ltd. for a new facility in the southwestern Indian coastal city of Kochi, local media reported. India has also held talks with Korean shipbuilders Samsung Heavy Industries Co. and Japan\u2019s Nippon Yusen KK, also known as NYK Line, a local official had said earlier.\n\n\u201cIt is a good move from energy security point of view since the dependence on China for a lot of these services is high,\u201d according to Rajiv Jalota, a former chairman of government-owned Mumbai Port Trust. \u201cThe world needs to develop alternatives.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "In a surprise move the European Union significantly tightened its sanctions against Russia\u2019s liquefied natural gas sector. Brussels\u2019 17th sanctions package announced yesterday includes three newbuild LNG carriers managed by Japanese Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd. (MOL) under charter with Russian energy projects.\n\nThe North Light, North Moon, and North Ocean entered service just months ago carrying cargo for Novatek\u2019s Yamal LNG project. A fourth vessel of the same series, North Valley, seemingly escaped sanctions, possibly because it did not yet carry any Russian gas. The vessel is currently en route from the Hanwha Ocean yard in South Korea to Russia\u2019s Arctic.\n\nThe EU sanctions will be doubly painful for Novatek. The company recently started using the North-series vessels to receive Yamal cargoes via ship-to-ship transfers at the Kildin anchorage near Murmansk. The vessels also come with an Arc4 ice-class designation integral to reaching the Yamal LNG plant during early summer and early winter when Ob Bay and the Kara Sea remain ice-covered.\n\nThe STS transfers became necessary following a transshipment ban in EU ports took effect on March 26, 2025. The new EU sanctions will further complicate Novatek\u2019s ability to export cargoes from Yamal to distant markets such as China.\n\nAll three vessels delivered cargoes to China in recent weeks. North Light received LNG in a STS near Murmansk on May 16.\n\n\n\nIt is unclear if EU sanctions, which take effect on May 21, allow for a wind-down period to deliver cargoes already en route. Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd. did immediately reply to a request for comment if it intends to offload the three vessels from its portfolio. The four North-series vessels built by Hanwha Ocean represent a significant investment of around $1bn.\n\nShipping database Equasis showing vessel details for \u2018North Light.\u2019 (Source: Equasis)\n\nIt is the first time EU sanctions against LNG carriers leapfrog U.S. measures. Justifying its sanctions the EU said the vessels \u201care operated in such a way as to contribute or support actions or policies for the exploitation, development or expansion of the energy sector in Russia, including energy infrastructure.\u201d\n\nBetween U.S. and EU sanctions a total of at least fifteen LNG tankers associated with Russia\u2019s energy trade have now been sanctioned. A number of gas carriers continue idling in the Barents Sea unable to load legitimate cargoes.\n\nThe North Light, North Moon, and North Ocean will add to another quartet of newbuild North-series vessels sanctioned in December of 2024.\n\nThe North Sky, North Air, North Mountain, and North Way have since been renamed to Iris, Buran, Voskhod, and Zarya. They also had their registration switched from Panama to Russia, possibly in preparation to use them as \u2018shadow fleet\u2019 vessels to load cargoes from sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 later this summer.",

      "text": "The Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has lifted the stop work order on the Empire Wind project, allowing construction activities to resume after a month-long suspension.\n\nThe $5 billion Empire Wind 1 project, designed to power 500,000 New York homes by 2027, represents a significant milestone in the U.S. renewable energy sector. The project, which began construction in 2024 and is currently more than 30% complete, faced a temporary setback when BOEM ordered an immediate cessation of activities on April 16, 2025.\n\nEmpire Wind also includes a potential second phase with a collective generating capacity of approximately 2.1 gigawatts.\n\nAnders Opedal, President and CEO of Equinor ASA, expressed gratitude to key stakeholders, including President Trump and New York Governor Hochul, whose collaboration proved crucial in resolving the situation. \u201cWe appreciate the fact that construction can now resume on Empire Wind, a project which underscores our commitment to deliver energy while supporting local economies and creating jobs,\u201d Opedal stated.\n\nThe suspension was part of a broader halt on offshore wind development ordered by President Trump, with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum citing concerns about the previous administration\u2019s approval process.\n\nThe decision prompted legal action from 18 states, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, aimed at protecting maritime investments and jobs.\n\nThe project\u2019s financial stakes are substantial, with Empire Wind holding a gross book value of approximately USD 2.5 billion as of March 31, 2025, including USD 1.5 billion in project finance term loans. The development also encompasses the redevelopment of the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, set to become the nation\u2019s largest dedicated port facility for offshore wind.\n\nMolly Morris, President of Equinor Wind US, emphasized the project\u2019s broader economic impact: \u201cEmpire Wind brings supply chain investments in states across the nation including New York, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Texas and South Carolina\u201d.\n\nThe project\u2019s history dates back to 2017 when Empire secured the lease for the designated area off New York\u2019s coast through a competitive process.\n\nFollowing an extensive environmental review, construction approval was granted in early 2024, with project financing secured the same year.\n\nMoving forward, Equinor will conduct an updated assessment of the project economics in the second quarter, aiming to maintain its 2027 commercial operation target date. The company plans to work with suppliers and regulatory bodies to minimize the impact of the recent work stoppage.\n\nThe resumption of Empire Wind marks a significant moment for the U.S. offshore wind industry, representing Equinor\u2019s continued investment in American energy infrastructure, which has totaled approximately USD 60 billion since the early 2000s.",

      "text": "2023 was the year when shipping really clocked in for the green transition.\n\nIn June 2023, the International Maritime Organization reached a historic agreement on a new climate strategy. 175 member countries agreed that global shipping should be climate-neutral by around 2050.\n\nDenmark was among the countries at the forefront of securing as ambitious an agreement as possible. It was a success. We can be proud of that.\n\nDanish shipping companies are also leading the way towards a greener future for our industry. A look at the order books clearly shows this. More than 80% of the ordered tonnage consists of ships that can operate on green fuels.\n\nLast year, Laura M\u00e6rsk, the world's first container ship capable of running on e-methanol, was put into use, and ESVAGT has the world\u2019s first service vessel for offshore wind turbines that can operate on green fuels underway.\n\nThese are just a few examples. Everything from large container ships and ferries to crew transfer vessels and everything in between that can operate on green fuels is on its way to the Danish shipping companies. Big steps are being taken in the right direction.\n\nOur biggest challenge is that the production of new green fuels needs to scale up significantly if shipping is to become climate-neutral by around 2050. This requires investments throughout the value chain and close cooperation between governments, authorities, energy producers, and companies.",

      "text": "As part of the European Commission\u2019s Fit for 55 legislative package, the FuelEU Maritime Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1805) promotes the use of renewable, low-carbon fuels and clean energy technologies for ships, essential to support decarbonisation in the sector.\n\nThe Regulation is fully applied from 1 January 2025 except for Articles 8 and 9 on monitoring plans that are applied from August 2024.\n\nLatest news:\n\nFuelEU delayed in Norway and Iceland (dated 18.12.2025): Due to delays in the process of incorporating the FuelEU Maritime Regulation into the EEA Agreement, the application of the Regulation will be delayed in Norway and Iceland. This means that Norwegian and Icelandic ports will be regarded as third-country ports in a FuelEU context from 1 January 2025 until the incorporation of FuelEU in the EEA Agreement. See also the announcement of the Norwegian Maritime Authority .\n\nKey facts about the FuelEU Maritime Regulation:\n\nFuelEU Maritime sets maximum limits for the yearly average greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of the energy used by ships above 5,000 gross tonnage calling at European ports, regardless of their flag. Targets will ensure that the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels used in the sector will gradually decrease over time, starting with a 2% decrease by 2025 and reaching up to an 80% reduction by 2050. The targets cover not only CO 2 but also methane and nitrous oxide emissions over the full lifecycle of the fuels used onboard, on a Well-to-Wake (WtW) basis.\n\nbut also methane and nitrous oxide emissions over the full lifecycle of the fuels used onboard, on a Well-to-Wake (WtW) basis. To reduce air pollution in ports, passenger and container ships at berth or moored at the quayside must use on-shore power supply (OPS) or alternative zero-emission technologies from 1 January 2030 onwards in ports covered under Article 9 of the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR), and from 1 January 2035 in all EU ports that develop OPS capacity. Member States may choose to apply the obligation to ports not covered by Article 9 of AFIR, from 1 January 2030.\n\nBy taking a goal-based and technology-neutral approach, FuelEU Maritime allows for innovation and the development of new sustainable fuels and energy conversion technologies, offering operators the freedom to decide which fuels and technologies to use based on ship-specific or operation-specific profiles. The Regulation also provides for different flexibility mechanisms, supporting existing fleets to find suitable compliance strategies and rewarding first-movers for early investment in energy transition.\n\nText version Vessels >5000 gross tonnes = 55% of all ships = 90% of C0 2 emissions from the maritime sector The FuelEU maritime regulation will oblige vessels above 5000 gross tonnes calling at European ports (with exceptions such as fishing ships): to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the energy used on board as follows:\n\nAnnual average carbon intensity reduction compared to the average in 2020: 2025: -2%; 2030: -6%; 2035: -14.5%; 2040: -31%; 2045: -62%; 2050: -80%.\n\nthe of the energy used on board as follows: Annual average carbon intensity reduction compared to the average in 2020: to connect to onshore power supply for their electrical power needs while moored at the quayside, unless they use another zero-emission technology\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nThe following questions and answers are intended to guide stakeholders in understanding the application of the FuelEU Regulation. They were prepared by the services of the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport of the European Commission and does not commit the European Commission as such.\n\nQuestions and Answers on Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC\n\nSecondary legislation\n\nA number of implementing and delegated acts related to the FuelEU have already been adopted and are published. These are:\n\nThe following implementing acts are upcoming, and public feedback will be requested soon:\n\nImplementing act on OPS communication\n\nImplementing act on the FuelEU database\n\nImplementing act on the criteria for the acceptance of zero-emission technologies\n\nImplementing act on the list of neighbouring container transhipment ports\n\nHelpdesk\n\nThe Commission and the European Maritime Safety Agency are available to answer any queries from stakeholders in relation to the MRV Maritime Regulation, the EU ETS Directive and the FuelEU Maritime Regulation. Please contact fitfor55 emsa [dot] europa [dot] eu (fitfor55[at]emsa[dot]europa[dot]eu) with any questions you may have.\n\nEvents and webinars\n\nEuropean Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) together with the Commission is promoting a series of webinars for a better understanding of the FuelEU Maritime Regulation. Information on the past and forthcoming webinars are available here:\n\nReducing GHG emissions - FuelEU Webinars - EMSA - European Maritime Safety Agency\n\nGuidance document\n\nThe Commission is currently working on comprehensive guidelines to assist stakeholders in the implementation of the FuelEU Maritime Regulation. These guidance documents will be made publicly available once finalised.\n\nESSF SAPS - Reports on FuelEU Maritime\n\nThese documents were prepared by experts under the European Sustainable Shipping Forum (ESSF): the sub-group of Sustainable Alternative Power for Shipping (SAPS), gathering in order to provide technical expertise relevant for the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2023/1805. These reports do not reflect the official view of the European Commission, nor are legally binding.\n\nGlobal decarbonisation actions under the IMO\n\nThe Commission, in cooperation with Members States, engages in the international work on reducing carbon emissions at the International Maritime Organization (IMO).\n\nIn 2018, IMO adopted the initial strategy on the reduction of GHG emissions from ships, setting out a vision to reduce GHG emissions from international shipping and phasing them out as soon as possible, with candidate short-, mid-, and long-term measures to adopt. In 2023 the IMO adopted the revised strategy , further defining its vision and guiding principles, as well as candidate mid- and long-term measures.\n\nCompliance actions with the FuelEU\n\nFor ships calling EU ports for the first time after 31 August 2024, the monitoring plan is due within two months of calling at an EU port.\n\nThe reporting period is the year for which the emissions of the vessel are monitored and reported according to the monitoring plan. The first reporting period is the year 2025.\n\nThe verification period is the year after the reporting period, during which the FuelEU report is produced for the reporting period, and subsequently verified. The first verification period is the year 2026. The first FuelEU report submission to a verifier is due on 31 January 2026, containing the data from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025.\n\nThe table below summarises the monitoring and reporting requirements for shipping companies, and their timelines.\n\nStep Description Deadline Reference Monitoring Plan Submission Submit a monitoring plan for each ship in the fleet, to be assessed by an independent verifier 31 August 2024, or within two months of calling at an EU port for ships not previously under the scope before that date Article 8 Monitoring Requirements Record data for each ship\u2019s arrivals and departures at EU ports, including: From 1 January 2025 Article 15 Ports of departure and arrival Dates and times, duration of stay at berth Connection to OPS or exceptions Fuel consumption at berth and at sea Electricity received through OPS The amount of electricity received Emission factors Well-to-Tank and Tank-to-Wake for each fuel type, encompassing all Greenhouse Gases Substitute Energy consumption Amount consumed at berth and at sea Ice class information Ship\u2019s ice class and voyages in ice conditions Annual Reporting Provide a ship-specific \u2018FuelEU report\u2019 to the verifier (for verification and calculation of results) 31 January each year, starting in 2026 (after the end of the first reporting period) Article 15(3)\n\nAdditionally, container ships and passenger ships within the scope of the FuelEU Regulation will have to comply with zero emissions at berth (connection to OPS or use of Zero Emissions Technologies) within the timelines summarised in the table below.\n\nStep Description Deadline Reference Zero Emissions at Berth Additional requirements for container ships and passenger ships above 5,000GT: Article 6 For AFIR-covered EU ports Compliance with zero emissions at berth requirement From 1 January 2030 For all EU ports with OPS Compliance with zero emissions at berth requirement From 1 January 2035 (or earlier as of 1 January 2030 at the discretion of Member States)\n\nRelevant links\n\nFull FuelEU Regulation Text: The official text of Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 September 2023 on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC can be accessed through the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nEU ETS: The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) has been extended to the maritime sector from January 2024. The extension covers CO2 emissions from all large ships (of 5 000 gross tonnage and above) entering EU ports, regardless of the flag they fly.\n\nAFIR: The Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation sets mandatory targets for the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure in the EU, for road vehicles, vessels and stationary aircraft.\n\nRenewable Energy Directive: The Renewable Energy Directive is a legal framework for the development of clean energy across all sectors of the EU economy, supporting cooperation between EU countries towards this goal.\n\nRLCF Alliance: The Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuels Value Chain Industrial Alliance (RLCF Alliance) is an initiative that focuses on boosting production and supply of renewable and low-carbon fuels in the aviation and waterborne sectors.\n\nEuropean Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA): EMSA also provides resources, updates, and documents on the implementation fo the MRV, ETS Maritime and FuelEU Maritime Regulations.\n\nEuropean Sustainable Shipping Forum: The European Sustainable Shipping Forum is a platform for structural dialogue, exchange of technical knowledge, cooperation and coordination between the Commission, Member States authorities and maritime transport stakeholders on issues pertaining to the sustainability and the competitiveness of EU maritime transport.\n\nEU Innovation fund: The Innovation Fund is one of the world\u2019s largest funding programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies.\n\nMRV Regulation: The MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) Regulation mandates the monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions from ships, by ensuring compliance and enforcement of emissions reduction targets.",

International shipping transports the majority of the world\u2019s goods and is responsible for 3% of global emissions, potentially increasing by half by 2050 on its current trajectory. To set international shipping on an ambitious zero-emission trajectory, we need commercially viable, zero-emission ocean-going vessels in the global fleet by 2030. Follow the Zero Emission Shipping Mission on LinkedIn Contact Us\n\nThe Plan\n\nCoordinated innovation needs to take place across the entire maritime value chain, from the ships to the future zero-emission fuels they will rely on, and the infrastructure that will supply them. This will drive the sector to a tipping point in its transition to well-to-wake zero-emission fuels as soon as possible. The Mission will focus on the following three areas to achieve the goal: ships, fuels, and fueling infrastructure.\n\nShips\n\nGoal: 600 large ships in international shipping are running on well-wake zero-emission fuel by 2030.\n\nProjects\n\nFuels\n\nGoal: Enable the production 16 Mt of heavy fuel oil equivalent (HFOe) well-to-wake zero-emission fuels by 2030.\n\nProjects\n\nFueling Infrastructure\n\nGoal: 20 key ports covering at least three continents offering well-to-wake zero-emission bunkering by 2030.\n\nProjects\n\nNews and Updates\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail address\n\n\n\nTo subscribe to the Zero Emission Shipping Newsletter, enter your E-mail address above!\n\nBy signing up you approve the Danish Maritime Authority\u2019s privacy policy and data protection.

      "text": "\ud83d\udca1 Mission Innovation\u2019s Technical Advisory Group (TAG) recently presented the key takeaways from the first annual review of the MI Missions\u2019 activities at the MI Annual Gathering 2024. The main findings from this review, as drafted by the TAG, can be found below. \ud83c\udf10\n\nMission Innovation (MI) comprises of 24 member governments. The seven missions are central to MI\u2019s activity around catalysing clean energy innovation. The key to MI\u2019s success is delivering on the Missions and demonstrating impact through them. All seven Missions are reviewed annually by an independent panel of experts of diverse geographical and technical backgrounds (the Technical Advisory Group \u2013 TAG) to ensure that the Missions are on track, to uncover any risks and barriers to Missions\u2019 progress, and to make the Missions aware of any gaps or opportunities that the TAG panel members may uncover. The first round of reviews took place in 2023.\n\nAll seven Missions are making progress in supporting clean technology innovation in the dynamic, challenging, complex and crowded energy landscape even though they are at different stages in their delivery. There is clear differentiation between missions and other global initiatives; in general, this is due to wide-reaching collaboration with international and national programs of work, via knowledge-sharing and bringing that wealth of knowledge under the MI framework.\n\nMission have had great success in producing impactful outputs. Highlights include:\n\nMissions identified a number of risks that could hinder progress, including: member retention, insufficient resources, difficulties with engagement (particularly with the private sector) and unequal distribution of workload. A key risk is that Directors are crucial to the continuing operation of their Missions and, in many Missions, there is no contingency in place to mitigate the risk of their departure, such as a Deputy Director.\n\nSummary of Recommendations:\n\nAs part of a rapidly evolving landscape, Missions must continue to explore opportunities for collaboration, including with other Missions where there are dependencies across sectors or for sharing of best-practice. With a wealth of experience now invested in the missions, the next step is to galvanise their leading role in driving the research and innovation that is needed to reach their goals, including much greater involvement with the Global South and the private sector. Both are integral for progress, enabling MI to increase its reach and impact. Missions need to be flexible to track and respond to changes in the complex clean energy environment, which may mean adjustment of Goals to ensure that these are within the scope of Missions to influence. However, Missions also need to be granted the space to implement their Action Plans as endorsed before announcing and making changes. It is critical to enhance the role of Missions in identifying gaps and barriers within innovation ecosystems and advocating best practices to strengthen national innovation ecosystems. Joint research and development (R&D) calls, such as the MI Call series, are a way for Missions to direct innovation. However, some Missions have had difficulty fostering international cooperation, particularly with non-European partners. Additionally, there\u2019s a need to articulate a qualitative understanding of successful pilot projects, whether conducted jointly or independently. Sharing insights into what works and why in these pilots, alongside strategies for replication, is essential for advancing innovation efforts. Building on Missions\u2019 development of qualitative KPIs, it is essential to expand quantitative KPIs as these are needed to track short-term operational and long-term progress. More qualitative information such as lessons learned should be recorded and shared via simple mechanisms. Communications came through as a strong cross cutting theme. Communicating success and outcomes of Mission activities is vital to achieving maximum impact. To support the Missions, MI also needs to improve its own wider communications, which will raise awareness of the Missions as a result.\n\nOverall, the Missions are making strong progress towards their respective goals and should be commended for the work they have delivered to date. We hope that these recommendations provide useful guidance to help MI and its Missions continue to increase their impact and meet MI\u2019s overarching goal of making clean energy affordable, attractive, and accessible to all.\n\nAcknowledgement:\n\nThe 2023 TAG review process was conducted by the following TAG members:\n\nDr Jenny Hayward (TAG Chair, Australia), Dr Michio Kondo (TAG Vice-chair, Japan), Dr Julia Reinaud (Breakthrough Energy), Ms Cynthia Handler (Canada), Professor Can Li / Professor Hongxian Han (China), Dr Vangelis Tzimas (European Commission), Dr Dagmar Sommer (Germany), Ms Araceli Fernandez Pales (IEA), Professor Rangan Banerjee (India), Mr Francisco Boshell (IRENA), Mr Per Arne Karlsen (Norway), Dr Malak Al-Nory, Ph.D. / Dr Turki Al-Aqeel, PhD, MBA (Saudi Arabia), Sir Peter Bruce (UK), and Ms Anna J Siefken(USA)\n\nThe following MI Secretariat members coordinated the process:\n\nRebecca Vignols-Clewlow , Kotaro NAKAMURA , and Belle Younsi",
