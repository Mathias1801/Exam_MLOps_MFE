      "text": "I R\u00e5det for Gr\u00f8n Omstilling mener vi, at tiden er inde til at accelerere den gr\u00f8nne omstilling og g\u00f8re Danmark fri for fossile br\u00e6ndsler \u2013 og her er \u00f8get elektrificering af alle sektorer afg\u00f8rende.\n\nEt bredt flertal i Folketinget har netop indg\u00e5et en aftale om havvind , der skal sikre tre gigawatt ny kapacitet fra 2033. Dermed undg\u00e5r Danmark at blive nettoimport\u00f8r af str\u00f8m, s\u00e5dan som Klimafremskrivningen fra april 2025 ellers pegede p\u00e5.\n\nL\u00e6s ogs\u00e5\n\nDerfor er det positivt, at Finansministeriet med aftalen f\u00e5r et konkret \u00f8konomisk incitament til at fremme elektrificeringen. Jo st\u00f8rre eftersp\u00f8rgsel der er efter gr\u00f8n str\u00f8m, desto bedre er business casen for de VE-udviklere, der skal opf\u00f8re de nye havvindm\u00f8lleparker.\n\nHvis elektrificeringen virkelig tager fart, kan aftalen p\u00e5 sigt blive en gevinst for statskassen.\n\nAftalen sikrer gr\u00f8n str\u00f8m\n\nStatsst\u00f8tten gives som s\u00e5kaldte CFD\u2019er (contracts for difference). Staten kompenserer udviklere, hvis markedsprisen p\u00e5 str\u00f8m falder under en fastsat t\u00e6rskel \u2013 og modtager omvendt betaling fra udviklerne, hvis priserne overstiger niveauet. Eftersp\u00f8rgslen p\u00e5 str\u00f8m p\u00e5virker alts\u00e5 direkte st\u00f8ttens st\u00f8rrelse.\n\nVi havde dog gerne set, at det nye havvindudbud var drevet af et \u00f8get elforbrug frem for statsst\u00f8tte.\n\nMen det er fortsat et afg\u00f8rende skridt, at der nu er landet en aftale, der sikrer gr\u00f8n str\u00f8m og direkte driver elektrificeringen af samfundet frem.\n\nAftalen er samtidig med til at frig\u00f8re EU fra russisk gas og afh\u00e6ngigheden af olieimport \u2013 og vi undg\u00e5r at l\u00e6gge os ud med Norge, n\u00e5r vi importerer store m\u00e6ngder af deres billige str\u00f8m.\n\nStatsst\u00f8tten kan ende med at blive dyrere for staten end en rettidig elektrificering. Britt Dam\n\nKlima- og energir\u00e5dgiver ved R\u00e5det for Gr\u00f8n Omstilling\n\nDen utilfredshed har betydet, at de helt konkret ikke vil forny to kabler fra Norge til Danmark, hvilket ville have fordyret den gr\u00f8nne omstilling betydeligt.\n\nDanmark kun p\u00e5 23. pladsen\n\nModellen er dog ikke uden omkostninger. CFD\u2019erne risikerer at presse business casen for VE-projekter p\u00e5 land, der opererer p\u00e5 markedsvilk\u00e5r.\n\nDet er problematisk i en tid, hvor vi har akut behov for at udbygge vedvarende energi bredt \u2013 og gerne s\u00e5 omkostningseffektivt som muligt.\n\nStatsst\u00f8tten kan ende med at blive dyrere for staten end en rettidig elektrificering, der ville have drevet udbygningen naturligt \u2013 og uden at skabe sk\u00e6vvridning i markedet.\n\nDerfor er det afg\u00f8rende, at aftalen f\u00f8lges op af konkret handling. Vi skal fastholde m\u00e5let om en firedobling af vedvarende energi p\u00e5 land og sikre stabile rammer og incitamenter \u2013 ikke mindst til de kommuner, der l\u00e6gger jord til.",

      "text": "Teknologien inden for kunstig intelligens har udviklet sig med raketfart de seneste tre \u00e5r. I en rapport udarbejdet af Kraka og Deloitte, peger eksperter p\u00e5 at AI indenfor 25 \u00e5r har reduceret arbejdsugen i den danske befolkning til 4 dage, og \u00f8get levealderen med 10 \u00e5r. Rapporten viser ogs\u00e5 at automatisering, herunder AI, har potentiale til at \u00f8ge den samlede produktion i den danske \u00f8konomi med mellem 42 og 89 pct. p\u00e5 l\u00e6ngere sigt.[i] De samfundsm\u00e6ssige effekter af AI og \u00f8get digitalisering debatteres ofte: b\u00e5de gevinsterne, men ogs\u00e5 den sociale slagside. Hvad der ikke debatteres s\u00e5 ofte er, at den \u00f8gede digitalisering ogs\u00e5 kan give store klimam\u00e6ssige aftryk.\n\nOver hele verden vokser digitaliseringen betragteligt \u2013 med et voksende dataforbrug til f\u00f8lge. Som konsekvens af corona-epidemien anvender de fleste i den vestlige verden i dag dagligt mere tid online end offline. Vores dag g\u00e5r med onlinem\u00f8der og dokumentdeling; vi er aktive p\u00e5 Teams, Outlook og sociale medier; vi skriver med ChatGPT; vi deler tusindvis af filer og fotos og om aftenen streamer vi tv-serier, film og andet indhold p\u00e5 YouTube.\n\nTilsammen giver aktiviteterne en himmelh\u00f8j akkumulering af data, der opbevares p\u00e5 et stigende antal datacentre med et stort energi-, vand og ressourceforbrug til f\u00f8lge. Morgan Stanley har estimeret, at CO2e-udledningen fra datacentre globalt forventes at stige til 2,5 milliarder tons CO2e indenfor 5 \u00e5r - Det er 2,5 gange h\u00f8jere end udledningerne fra den samlede globale flytrafik. [ii] [iii]\n\nF\u00e5 t\u00e6nker over, at deres daglige digitale forbrug, herunder af AI, er med til at \u00f8ge et stigende globalt energiforbrug i datacentre. Foto: Deloitte\n\nManglende transparens og fokus p\u00e5 CO2e-emissioner blandt techgiganterne\n\nOpenAI og andre AI-udbydere har valgt ikke at v\u00e6re \u00e5bne om deres energiforbrug fra deres Generative AI-modeller. Men helt nye estimater udgivet fra MIT Technology Review estimerer at det samlede klimaaftryk fra en gennemsnitlig prompt til en LLM chatbot varierer fra 114 til 6,706 joules afh\u00e6ngig af modelst\u00f8rrelse. Det svarer til 0,1 til 8 sekunders brug af en mikrob\u00f8lgeovn. N\u00e5r millioner af brugere dagligt anvender AI-chatbots, akkumulerer energiforbruget op.\n\nFor nylig fortalte Sam Altman, CEO for OpenAI, at brugen af h\u00f8flige udtryk som \"please\" og \"thank you\" i ChatGPT har kostet virksomheden millioner af dollars, da hvert ekstra ord, der tilf\u00f8jes i chatten, kr\u00e6ver processeringskraft fra computeren \u2013 og \u00f8ger dermed ogs\u00e5 klimaaftrykket.[iv]\n\nAlligevel har OpenAI gjort deres mest popul\u00e6re model ChatGPT mere samtaleorienteret og venlig. Den roser i h\u00f8jere grad brugeren for dennes input, og den ender hvert svar med et opf\u00f8lgende sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l for at holde samtalen k\u00f8rende og f\u00e5 brugerne til at engagere sig.\n\nKonkurrerende teknologivirksomheder f\u00f8rer til \u00f8gede CO2e-udledninger\n\nDe amerikanske teknologivirksomheder har ogs\u00e5 oplevet, at deres eget klimaaftryk de seneste \u00e5r er steget, bl.a. fordi de har skullet tr\u00e6ne deres AI-modeller og udvide deres datacentre. Microsofts CO2-udledning er steget med n\u00e6sten 30 pct. siden 2020, mens Googles udledninger var n\u00e6sten 50 pct. h\u00f8jere i 2023 end i 2019.[v]\n\nAI-modellernes tr\u00e6ning har vist sig at v\u00e6re en v\u00e6sentlig post i klimaregnskabet.[vi]Konkurrencen blandt teknologivirksomheder om at have den mest brugervenlige model f\u00f8rer til et st\u00f8rre dataforbrug og st\u00f8rre og mere komplekse modeller, hvilket for\u00e5rsager den st\u00f8rre drivhusgasudledning og dermed det st\u00f8rre klimaaftryk.\n\nFor selvom de fleste AI chatbots i dag er gratis at anvende, s\u00e5 er der penge i brugerne, og OpenAI indf\u00f8rte for nylig en funktion, der g\u00f8r ChatGPT i stand til at foresl\u00e5 indk\u00f8b og videredirigere til webshops. Der g\u00e5r sandsynligvis ikke lang tid, f\u00f8r virksomhedsbetalte shoppingforslag indg\u00e5r i feedet i ChatGPT, hvilket vil vende op og ned p\u00e5 Googles dominans indenfor annoncebetalt indhold.[vii]\n\n\n\nFigur 1. Antallet af ord der har indg\u00e5et i de st\u00f8rste AI-udbyderes sprogmodeller, over tid.\n\nSasha Luccioni, The mounting human and environmental costs of generative AI, 2023. Foto: Deloitte\n\nEr der nok (gr\u00f8n) str\u00f8m og vand til den \u00f8gede digitalisering?\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) har netop udgivet forskning, der understreger risikoen for, at verden vil l\u00f8be t\u00f8r for elektricitet til at udvikle AI m\u00e5ske allerede indenfor et par \u00e5r.[i] \u00d8gede geopolitiske sp\u00e6ndinger har over de seneste \u00e5r f\u00f8rt til volatile energipriser og bekymringer for energiforsyningssikkerhed. Beregninger viser at det kr\u00e6vede energiniveau for brugen af AI stiger med en \u00e5rlig rate p\u00e5 26 til 36 pct. Den eksplosive stigning i AI\u2019s energiforbrug rejser alvorlige sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l om, hvorvidt vores (gr\u00f8nne) energiforsyning kan f\u00f8lge med.[ii]\n\nDesuden har AI vist sig at have et massivt vandforbrug blandt andet til nedk\u00f8ling af datacentre. Det globale \u00e5rlige vandforbrug af AI forventes at n\u00e5 mellem 4,2 milliarder og 6,6 milliarder kubikmeter inden 2027.[iii][iv] Samtidig oplever vi i Europa en stigende vandmangel p\u00e5 grund af h\u00f8jere temperaturer og overforbrug af vandressourcer[v], mens prognoser viser, at 66 pct. af verdens befolkning snart kan st\u00e5 over for vandmangel.[vi]\n\nAI kan ogs\u00e5 reducere energiforbruget\n\nN\u00e5r AI k\u00f8rer p\u00e5 gr\u00f8nne energikilder, nedbringes klimaaftrykket betragteligt. I dag d\u00e6kkes mere end 46 pct. af Danmarks elektricitetsforbrug af vind- og solenergi. Men n\u00e5r den gr\u00f8nne energi er brugt op \u2013 for eksempel af de danske husholdninger, virksomheder, opladning af elbiler mv. \u2013 s\u00e5 er vi n\u00f8dt til at anvende den sorte energi, ogs\u00e5 til AI-tr\u00e6ning og -anvendelse.\n\nMen n\u00e5r den gr\u00f8nne energi er brugt op \u2013 for eksempel af de danske husholdninger, virksomheder, opladning af elbiler mv. \u2013 s\u00e5 er vi n\u00f8dt til at anvende den sorte energi, ogs\u00e5 til AI-tr\u00e6ning og -anvendelse.\n\nMen her kan AI selv faktisk vise sig nyttig. AI kan bidrage til reduktion af udledninger ved at forudsige energiproduktion og -forbrug, hvilket kan hj\u00e6lpe med at sikre, at energiforbruget sker, n\u00e5r vedvarende energikilder er tilg\u00e6ngelige. Det kan ogs\u00e5 udvikle nye modeller til at styre energiforbruget, og s\u00e5ledes optimere energiforbruget, ikke bare til modeltr\u00e6ning og -anvendelse, men ogs\u00e5 i bygninger og transportsektoren og reducere afh\u00e6ngigheden af fossile br\u00e6ndstoffer bredt set.\n\nEffektiv styring giver b\u00e5de gr\u00f8nne og \u00f8konomiske gevinster\n\nLige nu arbejder specialister og eksperter fra Deloitte og IBM sammen p\u00e5 l\u00f8sninger der kan m\u00e5le, forudsige og reducere det samlede digitale klimaaftryk i danske virksomheder \u2013 ikke kun fra udvikling og implementering af AI, men ogs\u00e5 hele virksomhedens digitale setup. Der kan nemlig v\u00e6re mange penge at spare, n\u00e5r virksomhedens digitale klimaregnskab g\u00f8res op og der udarbejdes tiltag til at reducere energi- og dataforbruget.\n\nFlere og flere virksomheder oplever stigende og ugennemsigtige IT-omkostninger, is\u00e6r fra de amerikanske tech-giganter, som de fleste virksomheders infrastruktur er bygget p\u00e5. Energiforbruget stiger, fordi virksomhederne skal drive flere datacentre, cloud-tjenester og AI-modeller, og der indk\u00f8bes nyt hardware, hvor produktionen ogs\u00e5 bidrager til klimaaftrykket. Samlet set bidrager det kraftigt til driftsomkostninger og drivhusgasudledninger.\n\nEffektiv styring af disse ressourcer bliver derfor afg\u00f8rende, ogs\u00e5 for at sikre, at virksomhedens essentielle funktioner kan k\u00f8re videre i tilf\u00e6lde af str\u00f8mnedbrud. Ved at anvende AI til at hj\u00e6lpe virksomheder med at spare energi p\u00e5 deres digitale infrastruktur, kan virksomhederne spille en aktiv rolle i at hj\u00e6lpe med at n\u00e5 de danske klimam\u00e5l.\n\nKunstig intelligens kan drive den gr\u00f8nne omstilling fremad \u2013 n\u00e5r den anvendes med omtanke\n\nDer er flere eksempler p\u00e5, at AI har et potentiale til at spille en afg\u00f8rende rolle i den gr\u00f8nne omstilling ved at optimere eksisterende systemer og reducere un\u00f8dvendige udledninger. Ved at finde og oms\u00e6tte store m\u00e6ngder data, for eksempel i form af tekst og billeder, kan AI bidrage med brugbar viden. Deloitte har eksempelvis hjulpet Milj\u00f8styrelsen med at tr\u00e6ne kunstig intelligens til at bruge satellitbilleder til at detektere f\u00e6ldning af skov og dermed bidrage til bedre skovforvaltning.\n\nP\u00e5 trods af AI's stigende energiforbrug, har teknologien ogs\u00e5 vist stort potentiale til at g\u00f8re verden mere b\u00e6redygtig. Foto: Deloitte\n\nAI kan ogs\u00e5 anvendes til at optimere komplekse systemer, hvor ineffektive l\u00f8sninger medf\u00f8rer un\u00f8dvendige udledninger. Dette kan for eksempel v\u00e6re bedre planl\u00e6gning af transportruter for et transportselskab eller detaljeret ruteplanl\u00e6gning for fly, der tager h\u00f8jde for aktuelle vind- og vejrforhold. UPS, et af verdens st\u00f8rste pakkeleveringsfirmaer, benytter AI til at tilrettel\u00e6gge deres ruter, hvilket sparer dem for 160 millioner k\u00f8rte kilometer om \u00e5ret, eller godt fire procent af deres samlede k\u00f8rsel.\n\nDanske virksomheder har ogs\u00e5 allerede igangsat initiativer, hvor AI fungerer som et v\u00e6rkt\u00f8j i den gr\u00f8nne omstilling. For eksempel bruger Br\u00f8nderslev Forsyning AI til at energioptimere fjernvarmen, mens M\u00e6rsk anvender AI til at optimere deres transportruter og dermed reducere transportens klimaaftryk.[vii]\n\nFremme af forskning og udvikling\n\nAI har ogs\u00e5 bidraget til forskning og udvikling, som kan resultere i nye, klimavenlige teknologier. Det er teknologier, der kan g\u00f8re den gr\u00f8nne omstilling billigere og hurtigere at gennemf\u00f8re og dermed reducere udledningerne af drivhusgasser. AI kan anvendes til at forbedre produktiviteten og reducere omkostningerne i vedvarende energisystemer, s\u00e5som sol-, vind-, og geotermiske kraftsystemer. Det kan ogs\u00e5 hj\u00e6lpe med at optimere energilagringssystemer for elbiler, hvilket kan forbedre energieffektiviteten og reducere det samlede energiforbrug.\n\nAI og den \u00f8gede digitalisering har alts\u00e5 et stort klimaaftryk, som stadig er ret overset eller \"skjult\" for almindelige mennesker. Men anvendes og implementeres det med omtanke, kan det udg\u00f8re en meget v\u00e6sentlig underst\u00f8ttelse af den gr\u00f8nne omstilling.",

      "text": "Demand for advanced propeller retrofits and energy-saving devices (ESDs) has nearly quadrupled since 2020 to enhance energy efficiency to meet tightening emissions regulations.\n\nClick to enlarge\n\nHowever, according to a new report from British class society Lloyd\u2019s Register (LR), while high-efficiency propellers can deliver fuel savings of between 3-10%, and popular devices such as rudder bulbs can achieve 3.5% reductions, only 1.74% of the global fleet currently features the rudder bulb, the most popular device, with the report making a strong case for retrofitting, giving clients an idea of payback times for their investments (see below).\n\nThe orderbook tells a different story, with 8.42% of vessels on order choosing to install ESDs. The proportion of vessels on the orderbook fitted with a particular device is between two and six times higher than for those vessels already in service.\n\nIn total, more than 10,000 vessels in the existing fleet and orderbook feature some form of propulsion energy-saving technology from newbuild. Added to this are at least a further 1,400 vessels that have had ESDs retrofitted since 2020. The number of installations on existing vessels is growing, showing nearly four-fold growth since 2020, with close to 1,500 vessels contracted to be fitted with devices by the end of 2024.\n\nThe report also reveals a trend towards retrofitting newer vessels, with more than one-third of 2024 retrofits performed on ships less than ten years old, compared to just 16% in 2020. By 2024, 12% of retrofits were performed on vessels built less than six years ago, a category that saw no retrofits in 2020.\n\nRegulatory pressure is identified as the primary catalyst driving this surge in retrofits. LR\u2019s analysis projects that a 20% fuel consumption reduction could save an aframax tanker operator nearly $3m over 10 years through reduced exposure to European regulations alone.\n\nClaudene Sharp-Patel, LR\u2019s global technical director, said: \u201cOur research reveals that propeller and ESD retrofits offer ship operators a proven pathway to significant fuel savings, extended regulatory compliance, and meaningful emissions reductions.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with Splash last week, Nick Brown, the CEO of LR, said that in the wake of the most recent Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting at the International Maritime Organization and the draft of an ambitious Net Zero Framework, this potential new legislation had \u201cturbocharged\u201d the business case to modify existing ships.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s suddenly made the return on investment on those investments in existing ships very, very obvious,\u201d Brown said of the proposed Net Zero Framework.\n\nBritish consultancy Maritime Strategies International (MSI) has given an early indication of the impact that the Net Zero Framework will have on the bunker market.\n\nBy extending the annual fuel consumption estimates calculated for 2024 through to 2035, and applying MSI\u2019s forecasts for bunker prices, it is possible to project the future fuel costs for conventionally-fuelled ships alongside the projected IMO penalties. By this approach, the IMO\u2019s penalties would be equivalent to an 82% premium on top of the fleet bunker costs by 2035 \u2013 almost $100bn for the 30,000 ships tracked in MSI\u2019s database.",

      "text": "By Arathy Somasekhar, Georgina McCartney and Trixie Yap\n\nHOUSTON/SINGAPORE, June 6 (Reuters) \u2013 Over half a dozen U.S.-loaded ethane vessels, originally bound for China, have stalled around the U.S. Gulf Coast after Washington requested U.S. exporters seek licenses to ship the shale gas to the top buyer, according to trade sources and ship tracking data on Friday.\n\nAround half of all U.S. ethane exports head to China, and the halt in flows has pushed ethane prices lower on worries of domestic oversupply and is likely to cut into profits of top ethane producers.\n\nEnergy Transfer and Enterprise Products Partners, two of the largest ethane producers and exporters, have warned the disruptions could impact their exports. The U.S. Commerce Department has also denied some vessels emergency authorization requests to export to China.\n\nLiberia-flagged STL Qianjiang, which loaded at Energy Transfer\u2019s Nederland terminal for China\u2019s Satellite Chemical, was anchored off the coast on Friday in the Gulf, according to LSEG and Kpler ship tracking data.\n\nEnergy Transfer, which produces ethane by extracting it from natural gas and then exports it from terminals along the Gulf Coast, said it received a letter from the U.S. Commerce Department on June 3 requiring the company to apply for a license to ship ethane to China.\n\nThe company and Satellite Chemical did not reply to requests for comments on the vessel.\n\nThree other vessels, which were set to load in early June, were anchored in the U.S. Gulf near Houston and Port Arthur, Texas, while three others hovered further south in the water after having slowed down.\n\nMeanwhile, Liberia-flagged very large ethane carrier (VLEC) Pacific Ineos Grenadier, which loaded at Enterprise Products Partners\u2019 terminal in Morgan\u2019s Point, Texas, and had been originally destined for China, was anchored at an Enterprise dock along the Houston Ship Channel on Friday after heading away from the Gulf Coast on Thursday.\n\nThe ship had not discharged on Friday afternoon and it was not immediately clear if it would. Enterprise has natural gas liquids storage facilities along the ship channel.\n\nThe vessel, a part of British petrochemical firm Ineos\u2019 fleet, has been used by the company exclusively for transit between the United States and China since August 2023, according to Kpler data.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners received the license requirement letter in late May, and on Wednesday said it received a notice from the U.S. government of its intent to deny emergency requests for three proposed export cargoes of ethane totaling around 2.2 million barrels to China.\n\nEnterprise has 20 days to respond to the denial, it said on Wednesday. Unless otherwise notified by the government by the 45th day after receiving the notification, the denials will become final.\n\nEnterprise and Ineos declined to comment.\n\n\u201cWith the curbs on U.S. ethane (exports), these ships are now struggling to move any cargo. So they are either just drifting out at sea or in a neutral direction hoping things resolve themselves with the recent meeting between U.S. and China,\u201d an executive at a ship brokering firm said.\n\n\u2018NO IMMEDIATE ALTERNATIVE MARKETS\u2019\n\nU.S. ethane production touched a record 2.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration, and was expected to rise to 3.1 million bpd by next year. Most of the output growth was expected to be exported to meet international demand as domestic consumption will likely hold steady.\n\nExports also climbed to a record 492,000 bpd last year, of which about 227,000 bpd, or 46%, headed to China.\n\n\u201cThese are distressed cargoes at this point. I would expect these to have been sold at significant discounts,\u201d said Uday Turaga, founder of energy research and consulting firm ADI Analytics.\n\n\u201cWithout China, there are no immediate alternative markets for vast U.S. ethane exports, directly impacting prices and profit for major U.S. producers due to specialized trade contracts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe letters from the Bureau of Industry and Security, an agency of the U.S. Commerce Department, said exports of ethane pose an unacceptable risk of military end-use in China, according to both companies\u2019 filings.\n\nChinese petrochemical firms use ethane as a feedstock because it is a cheaper alternative than naphtha, while U.S. oil and gas producers need China to buy their natural gas liquids as domestic supply exceeds demand.\n\n(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar and Georgina McCartney in Houston, Siyi Liu and Trixie Yap in Singapore; Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n\nSubscribe for Daily Maritime Insights Sign up for gCaptain\u2019s newsletter and never miss an update \u2014 trusted by our 109,032 members\n\n(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.",

      "text": "After months of inactivity Russia\u2019s nascent fleet of sanctioned LNG carriers is on the move again. The 79,800-cbm Arctic Mulan (ex-Mulan) pulled alongside the 360,000-cbm Koryak FSU inside Bechevinskaya Bay in Kamchatka late on June 2. The LNG carrier has been in ballast for the past five months suggesting that it will be receiving cargo from the storage barge.\n\nLast week industry insiders had pointed to Arctic Mulan\u2019s recent dash from the Mediterranean to Koryak in the Far East as an early indication that Novatek\u2019s protracted search to find a buyer for sanctioned gas from Arctic LNG 2 may have concluded. Sources say that a buyer has possibly been lined up for the sanctions-busting sale, possibly in China, though the destination of Arctic Mulan currently remains unknown.\n\n\n\nArctic Mulan previously loaded LNG from the Arctic LNG 2 project on September 22, 2024, subsequently discharging its cargo into the Saam FSU near Murmansk on December 20, 2024. Since then the vessel has sat idle in the North Sea and subsequently in the Eastern Mediterranean. It began a speedy trip across the Suez Canal, the Indian Ocean, and up towards Kamchatka on May 1.\n\nArctic Mulan\u2019s route over the past six months. (Source: Shipatlas.com)\n\nThe vessel also received a Northern Sea Route permit on May 28 clearing it to sail the Arctic shipping lane between July 1 and October 31; a further indication that the vessel could be used for renewed attempts to load at Arctic LNG 2 this summer.\n\nFellow shadow fleet vessel Nova Energy (ex-New Energy) may be next in line to load supercooled gas at Koryak. The gas carrier is holding position outside Bechevinskaya Bay. Unlike other dark fleet vessels, which discharged their cargo into Koryak and sister barge Saam starting last fall when no buyers could be found, Nova Energy remains loaded with product originally received at Arctic LNG 2 on October 2, 2024.\n\nHowever, losses from boil-off during the last eight months could total around 30-40 percent of the originally loaded volume. A visit to Koryak in the coming days would suggest a top-up of its cargo tanks to then follow Arctic Mulan to potential buyers.\n\nWhen loading at Arctic LNG 2 last year a number of shadow fleet LNGC engaged in deceptive practices disengaging or spoofing their AIS signals. A similar attempt may be under way currently by Nova Energy displaying irregularities in its signal, though it is too early to tell to what end.\n\n\n\nKoryak FSU has been visited by three shadow fleet carriers previously. Arctic Metagaz (ex-Everest Energy) called at the storage barge on September 22, 2024, followed by Sputnik Energy (ex-Pioneer) discharging its cargo on December 25, 2024. The final transfer to Koryak came on February 11, 2025 by East Energy (ex-Asya Energy). This left the FSU without any additional capacity. If Novatek, the majority owner of Arctic LNG 2, hopes to utilize Koryak as a transshipment hub this summer it will have to begin clearing cargoes.",

      "text": "Mining giant Fortescue is on a worldwide campaign to reshape the future of maritime decarbonisation with its flagship vessel, the Fortescue Green Pioneer, at the helm of a push to establish green ammonia as the marine fuel of the future. From Southeast Asia to Western Europe and soon South America, the 75 m long offshore vessel is sailing a message of zero-emissions shipping\u2014backed by real-world results.\n\nFortescue has set a target of eliminating scope 1 and 2 emissions from its Australian iron ore operations by 2030 and net-zero scope 3 emissions by 2040. Earlier this year, the Green Pioneer made headlines when it became the world\u2019s first vessel to complete a dual-fuelled ammonia trial in Singapore. Since then, its journey has evolved into a high-profile advocacy mission, stopping at some of the world\u2019s most strategic maritime hubs and political forums. The industry can lead while policymakers catch up\n\nIn March, the vessel arrived in the UK, berthing in Southampton and London\u2019s iconic Canary Wharf and alongside HMS Belfast on the Thames. It underwent the UK\u2019s first-ever Port State Control inspection of an ammonia-fuelled ship and hosted International Maritime Organization (IMO) decision-makers just as the global body reached a milestone agreement on carbon pricing for shipping.\n\nAfter fuelling up in Rotterdam, the vessel successfully completed a historic international voyage to the south of France via Gibraltar, marking another major breakthrough in demonstrating ammonia\u2019s real-world viability as a marine fuel.\n\nThe Green Pioneer\u2019s mission continues at speed. It is now headed for Monaco to participate in the Blue Economy & Finance Forum, before sailing in a flotilla to Nice for the UN Ocean Conference. Later this year, the vessel is slated to appear at COP30 in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil continuing its global climate diplomacy voyage.\n\nAndrew Hoare, head of marine systems and green shipping at Fortescue, commented: \u201cThe Fortescue Green Pioneer is proof that industry can lead while policymakers catch up. Every voyage demonstrates that zero-emissions shipping is not theoretical\u2014it\u2019s here, and it works.\u201d\n\nHe added that scaling green ammonia is essential: \u201cIf we can scale green ammonia, we slash emissions, unlock green fuel markets and future-proof trade. But delay will entrench uncertainty, destabilise supply chains, and deepen the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nAt Nor-Shipping 2025 in Oslo this week, Fortescue\u2019s executive chairman, Dr Andrew Forrest, took direct aim at the industry\u2019s reliance on LNG, calling it a \u201cgreenwashing\u201d tactic that undermines genuine decarbonisation. He accused shipping lines and the financial sector backing LNG-powered vessels of \u201cwasting a decade\u201d on expensive, low-impact transition fuels.\n\n\u201cThe choice is whether to waste the next 10 years on incremental measures that cost more and deliver less\u2014or deliver a real zero fuel standard that drives investment into real maritime decarbonization solutions,\u201d Forrest declared.\n\nA new study from the UCL Energy Institute\u2019s Shipping and Oceans Research Group and UMAS, commissioned by the Global Maritime Forum, concludes that the International Maritime Organization\u2019s recently agreed Net Zero Framework (NZF) sends a strong market signal favouring ammonia dual-fuel ships\u2014particularly from the mid-2030s onward. However, ongoing uncertainties in policy design are holding back early investments in e-fuels and alternative marine fuels.\n\nThe report uses a total cost of operation (TCO) model to evaluate various fuel pathways under the new regulatory landscape set by the IMO. While the NZF offers clearer direction for shipowners weighing fuel investments, several key policy elements\u2014such as the zero and near-zero (ZNZ) reward mechanism and surplus unit (SU) trading dynamics\u2014remain unresolved.\n\n\u201cMany stakeholders were waiting for clarity from the IMO to make long-term decisions,\u201d said Dr Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at the UCL Energy Institute. \u201cWhile some uncertainties remain, the case for investing in ammonia dual-fuel ships is now compelling\u2014even under conservative policy projections. In contrast, e-fuel producers still lack sufficient policy certainty to move forward at scale without additional government support or market opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe study finds that ammonia dual-fuel vessels strike the best balance of flexibility, competitiveness, and compliance from the mid-2030s, even without considering future rewards for ZNZ fuels. When likely developments in the reward structure are factored in, e-ammonia could emerge as a cost-effective compliance option as early as 2028.",

      "text": "Ocean-based sectors have emerged as a cornerstone of global trade, reaching a significant milestone of $2.2 trillion in 2023, accounting for 7% of world trade. A new Global Trade Update from UNCTAD reveals the robust performance of the \u201cocean economy\u201d while highlighting mounting challenges facing maritime commerce.\n\nThe maritime sector shows a mixed picture of recovery and challenges. While coastal and maritime tourism has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, maritime freight transport experienced a notable decline in 2023 due to weak demand and overcapacity. However, early 2024 saw a sharp rebound in freight rates amid disruptions in the Suez and Panama canals.\n\nTrade in ocean goods has maintained stability, bolstered by consistent demand for port infrastructure, processed seafood, and marine technology products. However, significant disparities persist across regions and sectors.\n\nLooking forward, the sector faces several critical challenges. Climate-related droughts and regional tensions are causing shipping delays and longer routes, particularly impacting Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries. Environmental concerns are also mounting, with sea level rise, plastic pollution, and biodiversity loss threatening port infrastructure and marine transport.\n\nTrade policy uncertainty adds another layer of complexity. Recent tariffs on steel and aluminum are driving up costs for shipbuilding and port facilities, while new maritime transport policies aimed at decarbonization could disproportionately affect nations with limited access to green technologies.\n\n\u201cThe ocean economy is not a niche. It powers supply chains, supports jobs and food systems, and drives innovation worldwide,\u201d states the UNCTAD report.\n\nTo address these challenges, UNCTAD has proposed a \u201cBlue Deal\u201d seeking $2.8 trillion in targeted investments across four key areas: mangrove conservation, shipping and fisheries decarbonization, sustainable ocean-based production, and coastal and offshore wind energy.",

      "text": "Norway\u2019s richest man, John Fredriksen, has launched a blistering critique of the state of life in both Norway and the UK, confirming he is relocating some of his business to the United Arab Emirates to escape what he sees as a Western world in steep decline.\n\nThe 81-year-old shipping magnate spoke candidly to Norwegian title E24 this week at Oslo\u2019s Tjuvholmen waterfront, where he was attending Nor-Shipping events. \u201cI try to avoid Norway as much as I can,\u201d Fredriksen said flatly when asked about the Norwegian government\u2019s decision to sell its stake in airline Norwegian, in which he is the largest private shareholder. The entire Western world is on its way down\n\nHaving long called London home, Fredriksen revealed he has now moved some of his business to the UAE, citing Britain\u2019s new tax regime as a key factor behind the move\u2014but not the only one. Late last year, he closed the London headquarters of Seatankers, one of his private shipping concerns.\n\n\u201cBritain has gone to hell, like Norway,\u201d Fredriksen said, expressing dismay over what he sees as creeping dysfunction in both countries. He accused both governments of overseeing environments where initiative is stifled and excessive regulation dominates.\n\nFredriksen didn\u2019t mince words when assessing the broader picture. \u201cThe entire Western world is on its way down and home,\u201d he said, lamenting what he sees as a weakening work ethic and complacency in developed nations.\n\nHe criticised the rise of remote work, calling instead for a return to traditional office culture: \u201cPeople should get up and work even more, and go to the office instead of having a home office.\u201d\n\nAsked about his views on Donald Trump and trade policy, the shipping tycoon dismissed them as \u201ccompletely hopeless.\u201d\n\nFredriksen\u2019s disillusionment with Norwegian politics and society runs deep. \u201cI gave up on them a long time ago,\u201d he said, noting his departure from the country in 1978. \u201cIt has only gotten worse. Norway is completely uninteresting,\u201d he added, with the only positive remark reserved for the country\u2019s public-sector workers: \u201cNorway is good for those who work for the state.\u201d\n\nDespite his harsh words, Fredriksen\u2019s shipping empire remains tightly linked to Norway. He retains major stakes in companies such as tanker giant Frontline and seafood powerhouse Mowi.\n\nFellow shipowner Arne Blystad was among those present at the event. He described Fredriksen\u2019s attitude as unchanged despite the geographic shift. \u201cHe is a bull, as always,\u201d Blystad told E24, referencing Fredriksen\u2019s famously aggressive business style.\n\nFredriksen, arguably the most famous name in shipping, does not give media interviews often but has used his trip to Nor-Shipping to get a number of issues off his back.\n\nFredriksen sharply criticised Norway\u2019s political climate for maritime business in an interview on Sunday with Finansavisen, a leading Norwegian business daily.\n\nFredriksen, now a Cypriot citizen, declared: \u201cThe framework conditions for shipping in Norway have never been weaker than they are now.\u201d His remarks come as frustration grows within Norway\u2019s maritime sector over what many perceive as eroding state support and a dwindling talent pipeline.\n\nFredriksen\u2019s warning reflects a wider unease among Norwegian shipowners, who have long felt sidelined by government policies seen as unfavourable to the shipping industry. His comments coincide with mounting concerns over a shortage of qualified maritime professionals, a shrinking domestic investor base, and the diminished role of the Oslo Stock Exchange in global shipping finance.\n\n\u201cShipping is almost wanted away,\u201d Fredriksen stated, suggesting that successive regulatory decisions have alienated a sector traditionally seen as one of Norway\u2019s most important industries.\n\nFredriksen also shared with Finansavisen his current investment strategy, telling the newspaper: \u201cWe are opportunistic and look for good investments\u2014not necessarily control.\u201d He explained his group\u2019s recent surge in equity purchases across multiple maritime and offshore companies including Star Bulk Carriers, International Seaways and offshore driller Valaris.\n\nFredriksen\u2019s strategy focused on undervalued shipping equities, with the expectation of strong returns as supply tightens and geopolitical volatility reshapes global trade flows.\n\n\u201cIt can be valuable to have gas in the tank when others run out,\u201d he noted, suggesting that liquidity and timing will be critical differentiators in the coming years.\n\n\u201cShipping has always been cyclical,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is who\u2019s prepared when the cycle turns.\u201d",

      "text": "London-based owner Zodiac Maritime has launched an emergency response following a fire that broke out on its 4,902 ceu car carrier Morning Midas.\n\nAccording to the company, the incident occurred at around midnight local time on June 3 in the Pacific Ocean, some 1,900 km from the port of Anchorage, during the vessel\u2019s passage to L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, Mexico. All members of the crew are safe and accounted for, and uninjured.\n\nThe 2006-built vessel is loaded with around 3,000 vehicles, 800 of which are electric. Smoke was initially seen emanating from a deck carrying electric vehicles.\n\nThe crew immediately initiated emergency firefighting procedures using the vessel\u2019s onboard fire suppression systems. However, the situation could not be brought under control.\n\nThe company said that, in consultation with the United States Coast Guard, all 22 crew members were safely evacuated via lifeboat and are being transferred to a nearby merchant vessel.\n\nThe relevant authorities have been notified, and a tug has also been deployed to support salvage and firefighting operations.\n\nAccording to the Equasis database, the vessel is co-owned by Zodiac Maritime and Hawthorn Navigation. Zodiac is also the manager of the vessel.",

      "text": "Realistic, pragmatic, or jaded? Splash readers are a funny bunch. Despite the huge amount of articles and columns carried every week on decarbonisation, 49% of respondents to our survey for our new Ship Concept 2035 magazine reckon that the majority of the global fleet come 2035 will still be using traditional bunker fuel.\n\nArguably no single facet will shape what ships look like in 2035 more than fuel, so one in two readers are inferring vessels will not have changed much in appearance 10 years from now, even if recent regulations do genuinely mean ships using traditional bunker fuel will be charged a lot more to move cargoes by 2035.\n\nShipping\u2019s long path to decarbonise received a kick earlier this year when member states of the International Maritime Organization agreed on a so-called Net Zero Framework.\n\nFrom 2028, when the measures will come into effect, use of very low sulphur fuel oil and compliance via the purchase of so-called remedial units \u2013 essentially carbon credits \u2013 could lead to costs of $2,500 a day for a non-eco capesize, rising to $15,000 a day by 2035 as standards tighten, according to calculations from Clarksons Research. We do not envision a one-size-fits-all fuel\n\n\n\nBritish consultancy Maritime Strategies International (MSI) has also given an early indication of the impact that the Net Zero Framework will have on the bunker market.\n\nBy extending the annual fuel consumption estimates calculated for 2024 through to 2035, and applying MSI\u2019s forecasts for bunker prices, it is possible to project the future fuel costs for conventionally-fuelled ships alongside the projected IMO penalties. By this approach, the IMO\u2019s penalties would be equivalent to an 82% premium on top of the fleet bunker costs by 2035 \u2013 almost $100bn for the 30,000 ships tracked in MSI\u2019s database.\n\nFrom another perspective, this also highlights the opportunity for the shipping bunker market \u2013 an annual pot directed towards drop-in biofuels and low carbon alternatives that could rise to $100bn per year within the next decade.\n\nEman Abdalla, global operations and supply chain director at Cargill Ocean Transportation, says of the IMO\u2019s new green rules, \u201cThere isn\u2019t necessarily a well-defined business case for anybody to go and immediately order ships for specific zero-carbon fuels, but at least it has definitely planted the right seeds so that we can start ordering dual fuel vessels or dual fuel capable vessels.\u201d\n\nData from Clarksons Research shows that less than 8% of the global merchant fleet in gt terms today is alternative fuel capable, although more than half of all ships on order will be able to use alternative fuels, a quintupling over the past decade. However, it is important to note that most dual-fuel ships coming out of yards today tend to use traditional bunker fuel most of the time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody, including myself, has that crystal ball to say, OK, which zero-carbon fuel is going to be the answer,\u201d Abdalla admits.\n\nPutting his own spin on the Net Zero Framework, Splash columnist Pierre Aury has some inconvenient truths for shipping, which he shares with readers.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no solution deployable at scale which can produce a carbon-neutral, whatever that means, shipping industry within a time frame consistent with preventing global warming turning from a runaway train to a slow-motion train wreck,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cWe will not be able to power any meaningful number of ships with either kites, sails, batteries, biofuel, hydrogen or nuclear fuel quickly enough so, whatever its level and its formula, the new fuel levy will only lead to more expensive freight and not to actual decarbonisation. This extra cost will drive some marginal efficiency improvements, which by the way will probably be offset by the growth of the fleet.\u201d The new fuel levy will only lead to more expensive freight and not to actual decarbonisation\n\n\n\nDr Kanghyun Song, who heads up decarbonisation for the Korean Register, tells Splash: \u201cWe believe that the era of multi-fuel usage in shipping will persist for quite some time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile a few leading fuel types will likely garner wider uptake we do not envision a one-size-fits-all fuel,\u201d agrees Bjorn Hojgaard, the CEO of Anglo-Eastern, the world\u2019s largest shipmanager. \u201cThere will still be a need to consider wider alternatives, taking into account available resources and risk mitigation through diversification.\u201d\n\nFactors affecting relevant fuel choice according to Hojgaard will include route distance, port infrastructure, ship size, ship type, and regulations that may also differ region to region.\n\nDepending on vessel type and trading routes, LNG, methanol, and biofuels will likely be the main initial options, KR\u2019s Song reckons. Once the production of green ammonia begins in earnest, ammonia is also tipped by Song to be adopted more widely.\n\n\u201cFor existing vessels, biofuels may be the only viable alternative, but they will face a severe supply shortage due to limited production,\u201d Song adds.\n\nThe key factor determining the production of green fuels is the availability of clean energy sources, which means that the generation of renewable power\u2014such as wind and solar\u2014will be critical. Song says countries with strong potential for wind and solar power\u2014such as the US, China, Australia, and those in the Middle East\u2014are expected to become major production hubs. The era of multi-fuel usage in shipping will persist for quite some time\n\n\n\nOther countries such as India, Colombia, Chile, and Egypt are also emerging as potential hubs for green fuel production, according to Prakash Chandra, a director at Fleet Management. \u201cTheir efforts will be vital in creating a robust infrastructure,\u201d he says.\n\nNuclear power is also under consideration, KR\u2019s Song says, but he warns there are still too many issues to resolve before it can be applied to commercial shipping, making near-term adoption unlikely.\n\nIn terms of what the fuel infrastructure will look like come 2035, Vikas Pandey, founder and CEO of ShipFinex, a ship finance specialist, reckons we will see a hybrid network of retrofitted terminals, floating energy storage units, and AI-optimised fuel distribution networks powered by real-time data analytics.\n\nConcluding, Nick Brown, the CEO of Lloyd\u2019s Register, tells Splash: \u201cThe next decade will determine the shape of the industry\u2019s long-term sustainability, demanding not just technological advancements but also greater investment in seafarers and human capital, which remain fundamental to creating the long-term change we need.\u201d\n\nTo access the whole of Ship Concept 2035 for free online, click here.",

      "text": "The Port of Corpus Christi has marked a significant milestone with the completion of its Channel Improvement Project (CIP), deepening the ship channel serving the nation\u2019s busiest oil export port.\n\nThe $625 million infrastructure initiative, which began construction in 2017, represents a major enhancement to the nation\u2019s energy export capabilities.\n\nThe expanded waterway\u2014now 54 feet deep at Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) and 530 feet wide\u2014will be able to accommodate larger vessels and two-way traffic, leading to projected annual transportation cost savings of over $200 million. The channel previously measured just 47-feet-deep and 400-feet-wide.\n\n\u201cThis accomplishment is only possible because of the steadfast support and cooperation of our non-federal partner, the Port of Corpus Christi,\u201d said Col. Rhett Blackmon, Commander for the USACE Galveston District.\n\nSince the lifting of the United States\u2019 40-year ban on crude oil exports in late 2015, the Port of Corpus Christi has emerged as the largest crude export port in the United States and the third largest globally. The port handles over 2.4 million barrels of crude oil daily and also ranks as the second-largest U.S. liquefied natural gas export facility.\n\n\u201cThe Corpus Christi Ship Channel Improvement Project unlocks a new era of economic growth for both the Coastal Bend and the nation,\u201d said Port Commission Chairman David Engel.\n\nThe project\u2019s success has already catalyzed regional growth, attracting more than $65 billion in commercial investments to the Coastal Bend over the past decade. The port\u2019s operations currently support over 95,000 jobs throughout Texas.\n\nThe CIP was jointly funded by Congress and the Port of Corpus Christi, with support from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and private marine companies.",
